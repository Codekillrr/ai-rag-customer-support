Using the Owner's Manual
Reading your Owner's Manual is a good way to
get to know your new Volvo, preferably before
driving it for the first time.
Reading your Owner's Manual is a good way to
familiarize yourself with new features and func-
tions, get advice on the best way to handle your
vehicle in different situations, and to learn how to
get the most out of everything your Volvo has to
offer. Pay particular attention to the safety warn-
ings provided in the Owner's Manual.
The intention of this owner's information is to
explain all of the possible features, functions and
options included in a Volvo vehicle. It is not
intended as an indication or guarantee that all of
these features, functions and options are
included in every vehicle. Some terminology used
may not exactly match terminology used in sales,
marketing and advertising materials.
Volvo continuously works to develop and improve
our products. Modifications can mean that infor-
mation, descriptions and illustrations in the
Owner's Manual differ from the equipment in the
vehicle. We reserve the right to make changes
without prior notice.
Do not remove this manual from the vehicle. If a
problem should occur, you will not have the nec-
essary information on where and how to get pro-
fessional assistance.
© Volvo Car Corporation
```
```
Option/accessory
In addition to standard equipment, the Owner's
Manual also describes options (factory-installed
equipment) and certain accessories (extra retro-
fitted equipment).
All options and accessories are marked with an
asterisk: *.
The equipment described in the Owner's Manual
is not available in all vehicles. Vehicles may be
equipped differently depending on market
requirements and national or local laws and regu-
lations.
For more information on which equipment is
standard and which is an option or accessory,
please contact your Volvo retailer.

Footnotes
Certain parts of the Owner's Manual contain
information in the form of footnotes at the bot-
tom of the page or at the end of a table. This
information supplements the text that the foot-
note number refers to. If the footnote refers to
text in a table, a letter is used instead of a num-
ber.

of these texts differs from the normal texts provi-
ded. Example of messages and menu texts:

order are shown as numbered lists in the
Owner's Manual.

indicate the direction of movement.
Arrows with letters are used to indicate a
movement in cases where the order in which
the instructions are carried out is not impor-
tant.

    online map service directly to the vehicle.
- Book service and repairs - Register your pre-
    ferred workshop/retailer on volvocars.com to
    schedule service directly from the vehicle.

```
Advantages of having a Volvo ID
```
- Only one username and password are nee-
    ded to access online services (i.e. you only
    need to remember one username and one
    password).
- If you change your username or password for
    one service (e.g. Volvo On Call), it will also be
    automatically changed for the other services.

Drive-E ‒ purer driving pleasure
Volvo is committed to the well-being of its cus-
tomers. As a natural part of this commitment, we
care about the environment in which we all live.
Concern for the environment means an everyday
involvement in reducing our environmental
impact.
Volvo's environmental activities are based on a
holistic view, which means we consider the over-
all environmental impact of a product throughout
its complete life cycle. In this context, design, pro-
duction, product use, and recycling are all impor-
tant considerations. In production, Volvo has
partly or completely phased out several chemicals
including CFCs, lead chromates, asbestos, and
cadmium; and reduced the number of chemicals
used in our plants 50% since 1991.
Volvo was the first in the world to introduce into
production a three-way catalytic converter with a
Lambda sond, now called the heated oxygen sen-
sor, in 1976. The current version of this highly
efficient system reduces emissions of harmful
substances (CO, HC, NOx) from the exhaust pipe
by approximately 95 - 99% and the search to
eliminate the remaining emissions continues.
Volvo is the only automobile manufacturer to
offer CFC-free retrofit kits for the air conditioning
system of all models as far back as the 1975
model 240. Advanced electronic engine controls
and cleaner fuels are bringing us closer to our

goal. In addition to continuous environmental
refinement of conventional gasoline-powered
internal combustion engines, Volvo is actively
looking at advanced technology alternative-fuel
vehicles.
When you drive a Volvo, you become our partner
in the work to lessen the vehicle's impact on the
environment. To reduce your vehicle's environ-
mental impact, you can:
```
- Maintain proper air pressure in your tires.
    Tests have shown decreased fuel economy
    with improperly inflated tires.
- Follow the recommended maintenance
    schedule in your Warranty and Service
    Records Information booklet.
- Drive at a constant speed whenever possible.
- See a trained and qualified Volvo service
    technician as soon as possible for inspection
    if the check engine (malfunction indicator)
    light illuminates, or stays on after the vehicle
    has started.
- Properly dispose of any vehicle-related waste
    such as used motor oil, used batteries, brake
    pads, etc.
- When cleaning your vehicle, please use gen-
    uine Volvo car care products. All Volvo car
    care products are formulated to be environ-
    mentally friendly.

IntelliSafe - driver support
IntelliSafe is Volvo Cars' philosophy regarding
vehicle safety. IntelliSafe consists of a number of
systems, both standard and optional, that are
designed to help make driving safer, prevent
accidents and protect passengers and other
road users.
```
```
Support
IntelliSafe includes driver support functions such
as Adaptive cruise control* which helps the driver
to maintain an even speed combined with a pre-
selected time interval to the vehicle ahead.
Pilot Assist^4 helps the driver keep the vehicle in
the current traffic lane by providing steering
assistance and maintaining an even speed and a
set time interval to the vehicle ahead.
Park Assist Pilot* helps the driver pull into and
out of parking spaces.
Other examples of systems that can help the
driver are the Active main beam, Cross Traffic
Alert (CTA)* and Blind Spot Information (BLIS)*
systems.
```
```
Prevention
City Safety is a function intended to help prevent
accidents. The function can help prevent or miti-
gate a collision with pedestrians, cyclists, large
animals or other vehicles. Light, sound and pulsa-
tions in the brake pedal are provided to alert of a
```
(^4) Depending on market, this function can be either standard or optional.

```
possible collision and help the driver act in time
to prevent it. If the driver does not react to the
warning and the risk of collision is determined to
be imminent, City Safety can automatically apply
the brakes.

Lane assistance (LKA) is another example of a
function that can help prevent accidents by help-
ing the driver - on expressways and similar larger
roads - to reduce the risk of the car accidentally
leaving its own lane.

The function Steering aid during increased
collision risk can help the driver reduce the risk
of the car leaving its lane unintentionally and/or
colliding with another vehicle or obstacle by
actively steering the car back into its lane and/or
swerving.

Protection
To help protect the driver and passengers, the
vehicle is equipped with seat belt tensioners that
pull the seat belts taut in collisions and other crit-
ical situations. The vehicle also has airbags, inflat-
able curtains and the Whiplash Protection
System (WHIPS), which helps prevent whiplash
injuries.

senger compartment or have a text message
read aloud.

Data recording
As part of Volvo's commitment to safety and
quality, certain information is recorded regarding
vehicle operation, functionality and incidents.
```
```
This vehicle is equipped with an event data
recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is
to record, in certain crash or near crash-like sit-
uations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting
a road obstacle, data that will assist in under-
standing how a vehicle's systems performed. The
EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle
dynamics and safety systems for a short period of
time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in
this vehicle is designed to record such data as:
```
- How various systems in your vehicle were
    operating;
- Whether or not the driver and passenger
    safety belts were buckled/fastened;
- How far (if at all) the driver was depressing
    the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
- How fast the vehicle was traveling.
These data can help provide a better understand-
ing of the circumstances in which crashes and
injuries occur.
EDR data is only recorded by the vehicle if a
more serious collision situation occurs. No data is
recorded by the EDR under normal driving condi-
tions and the EDR never registers who is driving
the vehicle or the location of a crash or a near
crash-like situation. However, other parties, such

```
as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data
with the type of personally identifying data rou-
tinely acquired during a crash investigation. To
read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment
is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR
is needed.
Furthermore, your vehicle is equipped with a
number of computers whose task is to continu-
ously control and monitor the vehicle's operation.
They can also register some of this information
during normal driving conditions, most importantly
if they detect a fault relating to the vehicle's
operation and functionality or upon activation of
the vehicle's active safety systems (e.g. City
Safety and the auto-brake function). Some of the
registered information is required by technicians
when carrying out service and maintenance to
enable them to diagnose and rectify any faults
that have occurred in the vehicle and to enable
Volvo to fulfill legal and other regulatory require-
ments. Information thus registered in the vehicle
is registered in the vehicle's computers until the
vehicle is serviced or repaired. In addition to the
above, the registered information may - on an
aggregated basis - be used for research and
product development purposes in order to contin-
uously improve the safety and quality of Volvo
vehicles.
For additional information, please contact Volvo.

Volvo Structural Parts Statement
Volvo is one of the leading companies for car
safety.
```
```
Volvo engineers and manufactures vehicles
designed to help protect vehicle occupants in the
event of a collision.
Volvos are designed to absorb the impact of a
collision. This energy absorption system including,
but not limited to, structural components such as
bumper reinforcement bars, bumper energy
absorbers, frames, rails, fender aprons, A-pillars,
B-pillars and body panels must work together to
maintain cabin integrity and protect the vehicle
occupants.
The supplemental restraint system including but
not limited to air bags, side curtain air bags, and
deployment sensors work together with the
above components to provide proper timing for
air bag deployment.
Due to the above, Volvo Car USA does not sup-
port the use of aftermarket, alternative or any-
thing other than original Volvo parts for collision
repair.
Volvo Car USA also recommends using Volvo-
approved replacement glass. The use of after-
market glass, particularly a windshield, can have
an adverse effect on collision avoidance and
advanced lighting systems.
```
```
In addition Volvo does not support the use or re-
use of structural components from an existing
vehicle that has been previously damaged.
Although these parts may appear equivalent, it is
difficult to tell if the parts have been previously
replaced with non-OE parts or if the part has
been damaged as a result of a prior collision. The
quality of these used parts may also have been
affected due to environmental exposure.

Driver distraction
A driver has a responsibility to do everything
possible to ensure his or her own safety and the
safety of passengers in the vehicle and others
sharing the roadway. Part of this responsibility is
avoiding distractions, including performing activi-
ties that are not directly related to controlling the
vehicle in the driving environment.

Your new Volvo is, or can be, equipped with fea-
ture-rich entertainment and communication sys-
tems. These include hands-free cellular tele-
phones, navigation systems, and multipurpose
audio systems. You may also own other portable
electronic devices for your own convenience.
When used properly and safely, they enrich the
driving experience. Improperly used, any of these
could cause a distraction.

For all of these systems, we want to provide the
following warning that reflects the strong Volvo
concern for your safety. Never use these devices
or any feature of your vehicle in a way that dis-
tracts you from the task of driving safely. Distrac-
tion can lead to a serious accident. In addition to
this general warning, we offer the following guid-
ance regarding specific new features that may be
found in your vehicle:

```
WARNING
```
- Never use a hand-held cellular telephone
    while driving. Some jurisdictions prohibit
    cellular telephone use by a driver while
    the vehicle is moving.
- If your vehicle is equipped with a naviga-
    tion system, set and make changes to
    your travel itinerary only with the vehicle
    parked.
- Never program your audio system while
    the vehicle is moving. Program radio pre-
    sets with the vehicle parked, and use your
    programmed presets to make radio use
    quicker and simpler.
- Never use portable computers or per-
    sonal digital assistants while the vehicle
    is moving.

Safety
The vehicle is equipped with a number of safety
systems that work together to help protect the
vehicle's driver and passengers in the event of
an accident.
```
```
The vehicle is equipped with a number of sensors
that may react in the event of an accident and
activate different safety systems, such as the air-
bag system and seat belt tensioners. Depending
on the specific conditions of the accident, e.g.
collisions at certain angles, overturning or swerv-
ing, the systems react differently to help provide
the best protection.
There are also mechanical safety systems such
as the Whiplash Protection System. The vehicle
is also built so that a large part of the force of a
collision is distributed to the vehicle's members,
pillars, floor, roof and other parts of the body.
After an accident, the vehicle's safety mode may
be activated if any important function in the vehi-
cle has been damaged.
```
```
Warning symbol in the instrument panel
The warning symbol in the instrument
panel illuminates when the vehicle's
electrical system is in ignition mode II.
The symbol will go out after approx. 6
seconds if no faults are detected in the vehicle's
safety systems.
```
```
WARNING
If the warning symbol remains illuminated or
switches on while driving and the message
SRS airbag Service urgent Drive to
workshop is displayed in the instrument
panel, this indicates that something in the
safety system is not functioning properly.
Volvo recommends contacting an authorized
Volvo workshop for repairs as soon as possi-
ble.
```
```
WARNING
Never attempt to alter or repair any of the
vehicle's safety systems yourself. Incorrectly
performed repairs to any system could impair
function and lead to serious injury. Volvo rec-
ommends contacting an authorized Volvo
workshop.
```
```
If this dedicated warning symbol is not
functioning, the general warning sym-
bol will illuminate instead and the same
message will be displayed in the instru-
ment panel.

Safety during pregnancy
It is important that seat belts are worn correctly
during pregnancy and that pregnant drivers
adjust their seating position accordingly.

Seat belt

The seat belt should fit closely against the shoul-
der, with the diagonal section between the
breasts and to the side of the stomach.

The lap section of the seat belt should lie flat
over the thighs and as far as possible under the
stomach. Never let it ride upward. Remove
unnecessary slack and make sure the seat belt
fits as close as possible to the body. Make sure
there are no twists in the seat belt.

Seating position
As pregnancy progresses, pregnant drivers
should adjust the seat and steering wheel to a
position that allows them to retain full control of

```
the vehicle (which means they should be able to
easily reach the steering wheel and foot pedals).
Try to maintain as much distance as possible
between the stomach and the steering wheel.

Volvo's concern for safety
Our concern for safety dates back to 1927 when
the first Volvo rolled off the production line.
Three-point seat belts (a Volvo invention), safety
cages, and energy-absorbing impact zones were
designed into Volvo vehicles long before it was
fashionable or required by government regulation.
We will not compromise our commitment to
safety. We continue to seek out new safety fea-
tures and to refine those already in our vehicles.
You can help. We would appreciate hearing your
suggestions about improving automobile safety.
We also want to know if you ever have a safety
concern with your vehicle. Call us in the U.S. at:

Whiplash Protection System
The Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS) is
designed to help reduce the risk of whiplash-
type injuries. The system consists of energy
absorbing backrests and seat cushions as well
as specially designed head restraints in the front
seats.
WHIPS is activated in the event of a rear-end
collision and adapted to the angle and speed of
the collision and to the characteristics of the col-
liding vehicle.
When WHIPS is activated, the front seat back-
rests move rearward and the seat cushions move
downward to change the seating positions of the
driver and front seat passenger. This movement
helps absorb some of the forces that could result
in whiplash.
```
```
WARNING
WHIPS is a supplement to the seat belt.
Always wear your seat belt.
```
```
WARNING
Do not attempt to alter or repair the seat or
WHIPS on your own. Volvo recommends con-
tacting an authorized Volvo workshop.
If the front seats have been subjected to
severe stress, e.g. in a collision, the seats
must be replaced. Even if the seats appear
undamaged, some of their protective proper-
ties may have been lost.
```
```
Do not place any objects on the floor behind or under
the front seats or on the rear seat that could prevent
WHIPS from functioning correctly.
```

## SAFETY



```
* Option/accessory. 47
```
```
WARNING
Do not squeeze box-like cargo between the
rear seat cushion and the front seat backrest.
If the rear seat backrests are folded down,
cargo must be secured to prevent it from slid-
ing forward against the front seat backrests in
the event of a collision.
```
```
WARNING
If a rear seat backrest is folded down or if a
rear-facing child restraint is being used in the
rear seat, the seat in front must be moved for-
ward so that it does not come into contact
with the backrest or child restraint.
```
Seating position
For WHIPS to provide optimal protection, the
driver and passenger must be seated correctly
and the system's function must not be impeded
in any way.

Set the front seat to the correct seating position
before starting to drive.

The driver and the front seat passenger should
sit in the center of the seat with their heads as
close as possible to the head restraints.

       child seat or booster cushion as determined by
       age, weight and height.
       Most states and provinces make it mandatory for
       occupants of a vehicle to use seat belts.

```
Seat belt maintenance
Check periodically that the seat belts are in good
condition. Use water and a mild detergent for
cleaning. Check the seat belt mechanism's func-
tion as follows: attach the seat belt and pull rap-
idly on the strap.
```

```
WARNING
```
- Never repair the belt yourself. Repairs
    should only be performed by a trained
    and qualified Volvo service technician.
- Any device used to induce slack into the
    shoulder belt portion of the three-point
    belt system will have a detrimental effect
    on the amount of protection available in
    the event of a collision.
- The seat back should not be tilted too far
    back. The shoulder belt must be taut in
    order to function properly.
- Do not use any type of child restraint in
    the front passenger seat. We recommend
    that children who have outgrown these
    devices sit in the rear seat with the seat
    belt properly fastened.

Buckling and unbuckling seat belts
Make sure that all passengers have buckled
their seat belts before starting to drive.
```
```
Buckling seat belts
```
1. Pull out the belt slowly and make sure it is
    not twisted or damaged.

```
NOTE
Each seat belt is equipped with a retractor
that will lock up in the following situations:
```
- if the belt is pulled out rapidly
- during braking and acceleration
- if the vehicle is leaning excessively
- when driving in turns
- if the automatic locking retractor/emer-
    gency locking retractor (ALR/ELR) is acti-
    vated. Each seat belt (except for the driv-
    er's) is equipped with an ALR function,
    which is designed to keep the seat belt
    taut when installing a child restraint. ALR
    is activated when the seat belt is pulled
    out as far as possible. If this is done, a
    sound from the seat belt retractor will be
    audible, which is normal. The seat belt can
    now only be fed into the retractor, not
    pulled out. This function is automatically
    disabled when the seat belt is unbuckled
    and fully retracted.
       2. Buckle the seat belt by pushing the latch
          plate into the receptacle.
          > A distinct "click" indicates that the belt is
             locked into place.

```
WARNING
Always insert the seat belt latch plate into the

3. The height of the seat belts in the front seats
    can be adjusted.

```
Press the button on the seat belt holder and
move the belt up or down.
Position the belt as high as possible without
it chafing against the neck.
```
```
The belt should be positioned closely against the inside
of the shoulder (against the collarbone, not down over
the arm).
```
4. Tighten the lap section of the seat belt over
    the hips by pulling the diagonal section
    upward toward the shoulder.

```
The lap section of the seat belt should be positioned low
on the hips (not against the abdomen).
```
```
WARNING
Never use a seat belt for more than one
occupant. Never wear the shoulder portion of
the belt under the arm, behind the back or
otherwise out of position. Such use could
cause injury in the event of an accident. As
seat belts lose much of their strength when
exposed to violent stretching, they should be
replaced after any collision, even if they
appear to be undamaged.
```
```
WARNING
Do not use clips or fasten the belts around
hooks or other parts of the interior. This will
prevent the seat belt from fitting properly.
```
```
WARNING
Never damage the seat belts and never insert
any foreign objects into the belt buckle. This
may cause the seat belts and belt buckles to
malfunction in a collision. There is a risk of
serious injury.
```
```
Unbuckling seat belts
```
1. Press the red button on the seat belt recep-
    tacle and make sure the seat belt retracts
    fully into the retractor slot.
2. If it does not fully retract, guide the belt man-
    ually into the slot and make sure it does not
    hang loose.

Seat belt tensioners
The vehicle is equipped with standard and elec-
tric seat belt tensioners that can help tension the
seat belt in a critical situation or collision.
```
```
Standard seat belt tensioners
All seat belts are equipped with a standard seat
belt tensioner.
In a collision of sufficiently violent force, the seat
belt tensioners will tension the seat belts in order
to more effectively restrain the occupants.
```
```
Electric seat belt tensioners
The driver's and front passenger's seat belts are
equipped with electric seat belt tensioners.
The seat belt tensioners interact and can be acti-
vated in conjunction with the City Safety and
Rear Collision Warning driver support systems. In
critical situations, such as if the vehicle brakes
suddenly, begins to skid or runs off the road (e.g
if the vehicle rolls into a ditch, lifts off the ground
or hits an obstacle in the road), or if there is a risk
of collision, the seat belts can be pulled taut by
the seat belt tensioner's electric motor.
The electric seat belt tensioner helps to position
the occupant more effectively in the seat, which
reduces the risk of the occupant striking the inte-
rior of the passenger compartment and improves
the effect of other safety systems such as the
airbags.
```
```
When a critical situation has passed, the seat belt
and the electric seat belt tensioner are reset
automatically. However, they can also be reset
manually.
```
```
WARNING
Never attempt to alter or repair the seat belt
on your own. Volvo recommends contacting
an authorized Volvo workshop.
If the seat belt has been exposed to extreme
forces, e.g. in conjunction with a collision, the
entire seat belt must be replaced. Even if the
seat belt appears undamaged, some of its
protective properties may have been lost. Also
replace the seat belt if it is worn or damaged.
The new seat belt must be type approved and
intended for the same seating position as the
replaced seat belt.

```
WARNING
If your vehicle has become water-damaged in
any way (e.g., soaked floor mats/standing
water on the floor of the vehicle), do not
attempt to start the engine. This may cause
airbag deployment, which could result in seri-
ous injury. Volvo recommends towing the

```
Driver/passenger-side airbags
As a supplement to the seat belts, the vehicle is
equipped with driver and passenger side front
airbags.

Driver/passenger side front airbags.

In a frontal collision, the airbags help protect the
driver's and passenger's head, face and chest
and the driver's knees and legs.

A collision of a sufficiently violent force will trig-
ger the sensors and one or more airbags will
inflate. The airbag helps cushion the initial impact
of the collision for the passenger. The airbag
deflates when compressed by the collision. A
small amount of powder will also be released
from the airbag. This may appear to be smoke
and is normal. The entire process, from inflation
to deflation of the airbag, occurs within tenths of
a second.

```
NOTE
The sensors react differently depending on
the circumstances of the accident and
whether or not the seat belt is used. Does not
apply to all belt positions.
In some accident situations, only one (or
none) of the airbags will be deployed. The
sensors monitor the impact of the collision
and react accordingly to deploy one, several
or no airbags.
```
```
WARNING
The seat belt and the airbag work together. If
the seat belt is not used or is used incorrectly,
the airbag may not provide the intended pro-
tection in a collision.
To help prevent injury in the event the airbag
is deployed, passengers should sit as upright
as possible, with their feet on the floor and
their backs against the seat backrest.
```
```
WARNING
Volvo recommends contacting an authorized
Volvo workshop for repairs. Incorrectly per-
formed repairs to the airbag system could
impair function and lead to serious injury.
```
```
The front airbag system
The front airbag system includes gas generators
surrounded by the airbags, and deceleration sen-
```
```
sors that activate the gas generators, causing the
airbags to be inflated with nitrogen gas.
As the movement of the seats' occupants com-
presses the airbags, some of the gas is expelled
at a controlled rate to provide better cushioning.
Both seat belt tensioners also deploy, minimizing
seat belt slack. The entire process, from inflation
to deflation of the airbag, occurs within tenths of
a second.
The location of the front airbags is indicated by
SRS AIRBAG embossed on the steering wheel
pad and above the glove compartment, and by
decals on both sun visors and on the front and
far right side of the dash.
The driver's side front airbag is folded and
located in the steering wheel hub.
The knee airbag is folded on the underside of
the dashboard on the driver's side. The text
AIRBAG is embossed on the panel.
The passenger's side front airbag is folded
behind a panel located above the glove compart-
ment.

## SAFETY

54

```
WARNING
```
- The airbags in the vehicle are designed to
    be a SUPPLEMENT to-not a replacement
    for-the three-point seat belts. For maxi-
    mum protection, wear seat belts at all
    times. Be aware that no system can pre-
    vent all possible injuries that may occur in
    an accident.
- Never drive with your hands on the steer-
    ing wheel pad/airbag housing.
- The front airbags are designed to help
    prevent serious injury. Deployment occurs
    very quickly and with considerable force.
    During normal deployment and depend-
    ing on variables such as seating position,
    one may experience abrasions, bruises,
    swellings, or other injuries as a result of
    deployment of one or both of the airbags.
- When installing any accessory equipment,
    make sure that the front airbag system is
    not damaged. Any interference in the sys-
    tem could cause malfunction.

```
Front airbag deployment
```
- The front airbags are designed to deploy dur-
    ing certain frontal or front-angular collisions,
    impacts, or decelerations, depending on the
    crash severity, angle, speed and object
    impacted. The airbags may also deploy in

```
certain non-frontal collisions where rapid
deceleration occurs.
```
- The airbag system sensors, which trigger the
    front airbags, are designed to react to both
    the impact of the collision and the inertial
    forces generated by it, and to determine if
    the intensity of the collision is sufficient for
    the seat belt tensioners and/or airbags to be
    deployed.
However, not all frontal collisions activate the
front airbags.
- If the collision involves a nonrigid object (e.g.,
    a snow drift or bush), or a rigid, fixed object
    at a low speed, the front airbags will not nec-
    essarily deploy.
- Front airbags do not normally deploy in a
    side impact collision, in a collision from the
    rear or in a rollover situation.
- The amount of damage to the bodywork
    does not reliably indicate if the airbags
    should have deployed or not.

```
NOTE
```
- Deployment of front airbags occurs only
    one time during an accident. In a collision
    where deployment occurs, the airbags
    and seat belt pretensioners activate.
    Some noise occurs and a small amount
    of powder is released. The release of the
    powder may appear as smoke-like matter.
    This is a normal characteristic and does
    not indicate fire.
- Volvo's front airbags use special sensors
    that are integrated into the front seat belt
    buckles. The point at which the airbag
    deploys is determined by whether or not
    the seat belt is being used, as well as the
    severity of the collision.
- Collisions can occur where only one of
    the airbags deploys. If the impact is less
    severe, but severe enough to present a
    clear injury risk, the airbags are triggered
    at partial capacity. If the impact is more
    severe, the airbags are triggered at full
    capacity.


## SAFETY



```
55
```
```
WARNING
```
- Do not use child safety seats or child
    booster cushions/backrests in the front
    passenger's seat. We also recommend
    that occupants under 140 cm (4 feet
    7 inches) in height who have outgrown
    these devices sit in the rear seat with the
    seat belt fastened. See also the Occu-
    pant Weight Sensor information.
- Never drive with the airbags deployed.
    The fact that they hang out can impair the
    steering of your vehicle. Other safety sys-
    tems can also be damaged.
- The smoke and dust formed when the
    airbags are deployed can cause skin and
    eye irritation in the event of prolonged
    exposure.

Should you have questions about any component
in the SRS system, please contact a trained and
qualified Volvo service technician or Volvo cus-
tomer support:

Occupant weight sensor
The Occupant Weight Sensor (OWS) is
designed to meet the regulatory requirements of
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)
208 and is designed to disable (will not inflate)
the passenger's side front airbag under certain
conditions.
```

```
Disabling the passenger's side front
airbag
Volvo recommends that ALL occupants (adults
and children) shorter than 140 cm (4 feet
7 inches) be seated in the back seat of any vehi-
cle with a front passenger side airbag and be
properly restrained for their size and weight.
The OWS works with sensors that are part of the
front passenger's seat and seat belt. The sensors
are designed to detect the presence of a properly
```
```
seated occupant and determine if the passeng-
er's side front airbag should be enabled (may
inflate) or disabled (will not inflate).
The OWS will disable (will not inflate) the pas-
senger's side front airbag when:
```
- the front passenger's seat is unoccupied, or
    has small/medium objects in the front seat,
- the system determines that an infant is pres-
    ent in a rear-facing infant seat that is instal-
    led according to the manufacturer's instruc-
    tions,
- the system determines that a small child is
    present in a forward-facing child restraint
    that is installed according to the manufactur-
    er's instructions,
- the system determines that a small child is
    present in a booster seat,
- a front passenger takes his/her weight off of
    the seat for a period of time,
- a child or a small person occupies the front
    passenger's seat.
The OWS uses a PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF
indicator lamp which will illuminate and stay on to
remind you that the passenger's side front airbag
is disabled. The PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF indi-
cator lamp is located in the overhead console,
near the base of the rearview mirror.


## SAFETY



```
57
```
```
NOTE
When the ignition is switched on, the OWS
indicator light will illuminate for several sec-
onds while the system performs a self-diag-
nostic test.
```
However, if a fault is detected in the system:

- The OWS indicator light will stay on
- The SRS warning light will come on and stay
    on and a text message will be displayed.

```
WARNING
If a fault in the system is detected and indi-
cated as described, be aware that the pas-
senger's side front airbag will not deploy in
the event of a collision. In this case, the SRS
system and Occupant Weight Sensor should
be inspected by a trained and qualified Volvo
service technician as soon as possible.
```
```
WARNING
```
- Never try to open, remove or repair any
    components in the OWS system. This
    could cause the system to malfunction.
    Maintenance or repairs should only be
    carried out by an a trained and qualified
    Volvo service technician.
- The front passenger's seat should not be
    modified in any way. This could reduce
    pressure on the seat cushion, which
    might interfere with the OWS system's
    function.

```
The OWS is designed to enable (may inflate) the
passenger's side front airbag in the event of a
collision anytime the system senses that a per-
son of adult size is sitting properly in the front
passenger's seat. The PASSENGER AIRBAG
OFF indicator lamp will be off and remain off.
If a person of adult size is sitting in the front pas-
senger's seat, but the PASSENGER AIRBAG
OFF indicator lamp is on, it is possible that the
```

```
person isn't sitting properly in the seat. If this
happens:
```
- Turn the vehicle off and ask the person to
    place the backrest in an upright position.
- Have the person sit upright in the seat, cen-
    tered on the seat cushion, with the person's
    legs comfortably extended.
- Restart the vehicle and have the person
    remain in this position for about two minutes.
    This will allow the system to detect that per-
    son and enable the passenger's frontal air-
    bag.
- If the PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF indicator
    lamp remains on even after this, the person
    should be advised to ride in the rear seat.
This indicates limitations in OWS classification
capability. It does not indicate OWS malfunction.

WARNING
```
- No objects that add to the total weight on
    the seat should be placed on the front
    passenger's seat. If a child is seated in
    the front passenger's seat with any addi-
    tional weight, this extra weight could
    cause the OWS system to enable the air-
    bag, which might cause it to deploy in the
    event of a collision, thereby injuring the
    child.
- The seat belt should never be wrapped
    around an object on the front passeng-
    er's seat. This could interfere with the
    OWS system's function.
- The front passenger's seat belt should
    never be used in a way that exerts more
    pressure on the passenger than normal.
    This could increase the pressure exerted
    on the weight sensor by a child, and
    could result in the airbag being enabled,
    which might cause it to deploy in the
    event of a collision, thereby injuring the
    child.


## SAFETY



```
59
```
```
WARNING
```
- Keep the following points in mind with
    respect to the OWS system. Failure to
    follow these instructions could adversely
    affect the system's function and result in
    serious injury to the occupant of the front
    passenger's seat:
- The full weight of the front seat passen-
    ger should always be on the seat cushion.
    The passenger should never lift him/
    herself off the seat cushion using the
    armrest in the door or the center console,
    by pressing the feet on the floor, by sit-
    ting on the edge of the seat cushion, or
    by pressing against the backrest in a way
    that reduces pressure on the seat cush-
    ion. This could cause OWS to disable the
    front, passenger's side airbag.

```
WARNING
```
- Do not place any type of object on the
    front passenger's seat in such a way that
    jamming, pressing, or squeezing occurs
    between the object and the front seat,
    other than as a direct result of the correct
    use of the Automatic Locking Retractor/
    Emergency Locking Retractor (ALR/ELR)
    seat belt.
- No objects should be placed under the
    front passenger's seat. This could inter-
    fere with the OWS system's function.

Child safety
Children should always be seated safely when
traveling in the vehicle.

General information
Volvo recommends the proper use of restraint
systems for all occupants including children.
Remember that, regardless of age and size, a
child should always be properly restrained in a
vehicle.

Your vehicle is also equipped with ISOFIX/
LATCH attachments, which make it more conven-
ient to install child seats.

Some restraint systems for children are designed
to be secured in the vehicle by lap belts or the
lap portion of a lap-shoulder belt. Such child
restraint systems can help protect children in
vehicles in the event of an accident only if they
are used properly. However, children could be
endangered in a crash if the child restraints are
not properly secured in the vehicle. Failure to fol-
low the installation instructions for your child
restraint can result in your child striking the vehi-
cle's interior in a sudden stop.

Holding a child in your arms is NOT a suitable
substitute for a child restraint system. In an acci-
dent, a child held in a person's arms can be
crushed between the vehicle's interior and an
unrestrained person. The child could also be
injured by striking the interior, or by being ejected
from the vehicle during a sudden maneuver or

```
impact. The same can also happen if the infant or
child rides unrestrained on the seat. Other occu-
pants should also be properly restrained to help
reduce the chance of injuring or increasing the
injury of a child.
All states and provinces have legislation govern-
ing how and where children should be carried in
a vehicle. Find out the regulations existing in your
state or province. Recent accident statistics have
shown that children are safer in rear seating
positions than front seating positions when prop-
erly restrained. A child restraint system can help
protect a child in a vehicle. Here's what to look
for when selecting a child restraint system:
It should have a label certifying that it meets
applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stand-
ards (FMVSS 213) - or in Canada, CMVSS 213.
Make sure the child restraint system is approved
for the child's height, weight and development -
the label required by the standard or regulation,
or instructions for infant restraints, typically pro-
vide this information.
In using any child restraint system, we urge you
to carefully look over the instructions that are
provided with the restraint. Be sure you under-
stand them and can use the device properly and
safely in this vehicle. A misused child restraint
system can result in increased injuries for both
the infant or child and other occupants in the
vehicle.
```
```
When a child has outgrown the child safety seat,
you should use the rear seat with the standard
seat belt fastened. The best way to help protect
the child here is to place the child on a cushion
so that the seat belt is properly located on the
hips. Legislation in your state or province may
mandate the use of a child seat or cushion in
combination with the seat belt, depending on the
child's age and/or size. Please check local regu-
lations.
A specially designed and tested booster cushion
and backrest can be obtained from your Volvo
retailer. See also the article "Integrated booster
cushion."
```

## ||

## SAFETY

64

```
WARNING
```
- Do not use child safety seats or child
    booster cushions/backrests in the front
    passenger's seat. We also recommend
    that children under 140 cm (4 feet
    7 inches) in height who have outgrown
    these devices sit in the rear seat with the
    seat belt fastened.
- Sedan models: Keep vehicle doors and
    trunk locked and keep remote controls
    out of a child's reach. Unsupervised chil-
    dren could lock themselves in an open
    trunk and risk injury. Children should be
    taught not to play in vehicles.
- On hot days, the temperature in the vehi-
    cle interior can rise very quickly. Exposure
    to these high temperatures for even a
    short period of time can cause heat-rela-
    ted injury or death. Small children are par-
    ticularly at risk. Never leave children unat-
    tended in a vehicle.

```
Child seats should always be registered.
```
```
Volvo's recommendations
Why does Volvo believe that no child should sit in
the front seat of a vehicle? It's quite simple really.
A front airbag is a very powerful device designed,
by law, to help protect an adult.
```
```
Because of the size of the airbag and its speed
of inflation, a child should never be placed in the
front seat, even if he or she is properly belted or
strapped into a child safety seat. Volvo has been
an innovator in the field of safety since it was
founded. And we have no intention of resting on
our laurels. But we need your help. Please
remember to put your children in the back seat,
and buckle them up.
```
```
WARNING
A child restraint should never be reused if:
```
- The vehicle has been involved in a colli-
    sion, no matter how minor
- Its history is unknown
- It is older than the manufacturer's expira-
    tion date

```
Volvo has some very specific
recommendations
```
- Always wear your seat belt.
- Airbags are a SUPPLEMENTAL safety
    device which, when used with a three-point
    seat belt can help reduce serious injuries
    during certain types of accidents. Volvo rec-
    ommends that you do not disconnect the air-
    bag system in your vehicle.
- Volvo strongly recommends that everyone in
    the vehicle be properly restrained.
       - Volvo recommends that ALL occupants
          (adults and children) shorter than 140 cm
          (4 feet 7 inches) be seated in the rear seat
          of any vehicle with a front passenger side air-
          bag.
       - Drive safely!

Child restraints
Suitable child restraints should always be used
when children travel in the vehicle.

Child restraint systems

Infant seat

There are three main types of child restraint sys-
tems: infant seats, convertible seats and booster
cushions. They are classified according to the
child's age and size.

The child restraint should be secured using a
three-point seat belt, ISOFIX/LATCH anchors or
top tether anchors.

```
Convertible seat
```
```
WARNING
A child seat should never be used in the front
passenger seat of any vehicle with a front
passenger airbag - not even if the "Passenger
airbag off" symbol near the rear-view mirror is
illuminated. If the severity of an accident were
to cause the airbag to inflate, this could lead
to serious injury or death to a child seated in
this position.
```
```
Booster cushion
```
```
WARNING
Always refer to the child restraint manufactur-
er's instructions for detailed information on
securing the restraint.
```

## ||

## SAFETY

66

```
WARNING
```
- When not in use, keep the child restraint
    system secured or remove it from the
    passenger compartment to help prevent it
    from injuring passengers in the event of a
    sudden stop or collision.
- A small child's head represents a consid-
    erable part of its total weight and its neck
    is still very weak. Volvo recommends that
    children up to age 4 travel, properly
    restrained, facing rearward. In addition,
    Volvo recommends that children should
    ride rearward facing, properly restrained,
    as long as possible.

```
Automatic Locking Retractor/
Emergency Locking Retractor (ALR/
ELR)
To make child seat installation easier, each seat
belt (except for the driver's belt) is equipped with
a locking mechanism to help keep the seat belt
taut.
When attaching the seat belt to a child seat:
```
1. Attach the seat belt to the child seat accord-
    ing to the child seat manufacturer's instruc-
    tions.
2. Pull the seat belt out as far as possible.
3. Insert the seat belt latch plate into the buckle
    (lock) in the usual way.
       4. Release the seat belt and pull it taut around
          the child seat.
       A sound from the seat belt retractor will be audi-
       ble at this time and is normal. The belt will now
       be locked in place. This function is automatically
       disabled when the seat belt is unlocked and the
       belt is fully retracted.

```
WARNING
Do not use child safety seats or child booster
cushions/backrests in the front passenger's
seat. We also recommend that children who
have outgrown these devices sit in the rear
seat with the seat belt properly fastened.
```
```
Child restraint registration and recalls
Child restraints could be recalled for safety rea-
sons. You must register your child restraint to be
reached in a recall. To stay informed about child
safety seat recalls, be sure to fill out and return
the registration card that comes with new child
restraints.
Child restraint recall information is readily availa-
ble in both the U.S. and Canada. For recall infor-
mation in the U.S., call the U.S. Government's
Auto Safety Hotline at 1-800-424-9393 or go to

    anchors be used when installing a for-
    ward-facing child restraint.
- Never route a top tether strap over the
    top of the head restraint. The strap
    should be routed beneath the head
    restraint.
- Child restraint anchorages are designed
    to withstand only those loads imposed by
    correctly fitted child restraints. Under no
    circumstances are they to be used for
    adult seat belts or harnesses. The ancho-
    rages are not able to withstand excessive
    forces on them in the event of collision if

Instrument panel
The instrument panel displays information rela-
ted to the vehicle and driving.
The instrument panel contains gauges, indicators
and monitoring and warning symbols. What is
shown in the instrument panel varies depending
on the equipment, settings and functions cur-
rently active.
```
```
The instrument panel is activated as soon as a
door is opened, i.e. in ignition mode 0. The panel
will power down after a short period of time if it is
not used. To reactivate it, do one of the following:
```
- Depress the brake pedal.
- Activate ignition mode I.
- Open one of the doors.

```
The instrument panel is available in two versions:
12"* and 8".
```
```
WARNING
If the instrument panel is not functioning
properly, information about brakes, airbags or
other safety-related systems may not be dis-
played. The driver will then not be able to
check the status of the vehicle systems or
receive relevant warnings and information.
```
```
WARNING
If the instrument panel turns off, does not
activate when the ignition is switched on, or
part/all of the panel cannot be read, do not
drive the vehicle. Consult a workshop immedi-
ately. Volvo recommends an authorized Volvo
workshop.

To help promote fuel-efficient driving, data is
recorded on both current and average fuel con-
sumption. Data from the trip computer can be
displayed in the instrument panel.

12" instrument panel*.
```
```
8-inch instrument panel.
The trip computer includes the following gauges:
```
- Trip odometer
- Odometer
- Current fuel consumption
    - Distance to empty tank
    - Tourist - alternative speedometer
    Unit standards for distance, speed, etc. can be
    changed via system settings in the center display.

```
Trip odometer
There are two trip odometers: TM and TA.
TM can be reset manually and TA is reset auto-
matically if the vehicle is not used for four hours.
During a drive, the trip odometer registers data
on:
```
- Mileage
- Driving time
- Average speed
- Average fuel consumption
The readings since the trip odometer's last reset
are displayed.

```
Odometer
The odometer records the vehicle's total mileage.
This reading cannot be reset.
```
```
Current fuel consumption
This gauge shows the vehicle's fuel consumption
at that moment. The reading is updated about
once a second.
```
```
Distance to empty tank
The trip computer calculates the distance that
can be driven on the fuel remaining in the tank.
```
```
This calculation is based on average fuel con-
sumption during the last 30 km (20 miles) and
the amount of fuel remaining in the tank.
When the gauge displays "----", there is not
enough fuel remaining to calculate the remaining
mileage. Refuel as soon as possible.
```
```
NOTE
This may vary if your driving style changes.
```
```
An economical driving style will generally
increase how far you can drive on a certain
amount of fuel.
```
```
Tourist - alternative speedometer
The alternative digital speedometer makes it eas-
ier to drive in countries where speed limit signs
are shown in a different measurement unit than
the one shown in the vehicle's gauges.
When used, the digital speed is displayed in the
opposite unit to that shown in the analog speed-
ometer. If mph is used in the analog speedome-
ter, the equivalent speed in km/h will be shown
in the digital speedometer.

1. 1 Copyright 1996-1999 by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
    Introduction The FreeType Project is
    distributed in several archive packages; some
    of them may contain, in addition to the
    FreeType font engine, various tools and
    contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
    FreeType Project. This license applies to all
    files found in such packages, and which do
    not fall under their own explicit license. The
    license affects thus the FreeType font
    engine, the test programs, documentation
    and makefiles, at the very least. This license
    was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
    (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which
    all encourage inclusion and use of free
    software in commercial and freeware
    products alike. As a consequence, its main
    points are that: o We don't promise that this
    software works. However, we are be
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'
    distribution) o You can use this software for
    whatever you want, in parts or full form,
    without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'
    usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote
    this software. If you use it, or only parts of it,
    in a program, you must acknowledge
    somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the FreeType code. (`credits')
    We specifically permit and encourage the
    inclusion of this software, with or without
    modifications, in commercial products,

Handling the center display
Many of the vehicle's functions and features can
be controlled and adjusted from the center dis-
play. The center display is a touchscreen that
reacts to taps and other gestures.
```
```
Using the center display's touchscreen
The touchscreen reacts differently depending on
whether the user taps, drags or swipes the
screen. It is possible to e.g. move between differ-
```
```
ent views, mark objects, scroll in a list and move
apps by touching the screen in various ways.
An infrared light curtain just above the surface of
the screen enables the screen to detect when a
finger is directly in front of the screen. This tech-
nology makes it possible to use the screen even
while wearing gloves.
Two people can interact with the screen at the
same time, e.g. to adjust climate system settings
for both the driver and passenger sides.
```
```
CAUTION
Do not use sharp objects on the screen as
this could cause scratches.
```
```
The following table presents the various proce-
dures for using the screen:

Driver profiles
Many of the vehicle's settings can be custom-
ized to the driver's personal preferences and
saved in one or more driver profiles.
These personal settings are automatically saved
in the active driver profile. Each key can be linked
to one driver profile. When the linked key is used,
the vehicle is customized to the specific settings
of that driver profile.
```
```
Which settings are saved in driver
profiles?
The vehicle has settings that can be made either
personal or global. The personal settings are
saved in driver profiles.
Settings that can be saved in a driver profile
include, among other things, screens, mirrors,
front seats, navigation*, audio and media system,
language and voice control.
Some settings are global settings. These settings
can be changed but are not saved to a specific
driver profile. Changes to global settings affect all
profiles.
```

Global settings
Global settings and parameters do not change
when driver profiles are changed. They remain
the same regardless of which driver profile is cur-
rently active.
Keyboard layout is an example of a global setting.
If driver profile X is used to add additional key-
board languages, these languages will also be
available for driver profile Y. The settings for key-
board layout are not saved to a specific driver
profile - the settings are global.
Personal settings
If driver profile X has been used to e.g., set the
brightness for the center display, driver profile Y
will not be affected by this setting. It will only be
saved to driver profile X because brightness set-
ting is a personal setting.

ken commands from the user and verbal respon-
ses from the system. The voice control system
uses the same microphone as devices connected
with Bluetooth, and the voice control system
responds through the vehicle's loudspeakers. In
certain cases, text messages will also be dis-
played in the instrument panel. The functions are
controlled using the right-side steering wheel
keypad and settings are made in the center dis-
play.
System updates
The voice control system is continuously
improved. For optimal functionality, always down-
load the latest update at support.volvocars.com.

## LIGHTING

 

```
* Option/accessory. 155
```
Active high beam
Active high beams is a function that uses cam-
era sensors in the upper edge of the windshield
to detect the headlights of approaching vehicles
or the taillights of the vehicle directly ahead.
When either of these is detected, the vehicle's
headlights will automatically switch from high
beams to low beams.

Active high beam is enabled by moving the lighting ring
on the steering wheel lever to.

The function can also detect street lighting.
When the camera sensor no longer detects an
approaching vehicle or a vehicle ahead, the head-
lights will return to high beams.

```
This function can be used in dark conditions
when the vehicle's speed is approx. 20 km/h
(approx. 12 mph) or higher.
If active high beams are deactivated when the
high beams are on, the headlights will automati-
cally switch to low beams.
When active high beams are activated, a white
symbol will be displayed in the instrument
panel.
When high beams are on, the symbol will be blue.
For LED headlights, this applies even if the high
beams are partially dimmed, i.e. if the headlights
are illuminated with slightly more than low beams.
Vehicles with halogen headlights
When the camera sensor no longer detects the
headlights of approaching vehicles or the tail-
lights of a vehicle ahead, the headlights will
return to high beams after a second or so.
Vehicles with LED^3 headlights *
If the active high beams are equipped with the
auto on/off function^4 , the headlights will return to
high beams a second or so after the camera sen-
sor no longer detects the headlights of approach-
ing vehicles or the taillights of a vehicle ahead.
Limitations for active high beams
The camera sensor on which the function is
based has limitations.
```
```
If this symbol and the message Active
High Beam Temporarily
unavailable is displayed in the instru-
ment panel, switching between high
and low beams must be done manually. The light-
ing ring on the steering wheel lever can remain in
the position. The symbol will go out
when the message is displayed.
The same applies if this symbol along
with the message Windscreen
sensor Sensor blocked, see
Owner's manual is displayed.
Active high beams may be temporarily unavailable
in certain situations, e.g. heavy fog or rain. When
active high beams become available again, or the
windshield sensors are no longer blocked, the
message will disappear and the symbol will
be displayed.
```
```
WARNING
Automatic high beam is an aid in using the
best possible light based on prevailing condi-
tions.
The driver is always responsible for manually
switching between high and low beam when
traffic situations or weather conditions require
this.

Pinch protection for windows and
sun curtains
All windows and sun curtains* that are controlled
electrically have a pinch protection function that
is triggered if anything blocks them while they
are opening or closing.
If pinch protection is activated, movement will
stop and then retract automatically to approx.
50 mm (2 inches) from the point at which it was
blocked (or to full ventilation position).
If pinch protection has been triggered, it is still
possible to operate the window or sun curtain
once more in the same direction without pinch
protection, if this is done within 10 seconds after
pinch protection has been triggered. It is thus still
possible to override pinch protection when clos-
ing is interrupted (e.g. due to ice) by pressing and
holding down the control until the window or sun
curtain is fully closed.
```
```
WARNING
If the starter battery is disconnected, the func-
tion for automatic opening and closing must
be reset to function correctly. A reset is
required in order for the pinch protection to
work.

Climate control sensors
The climate system has a number of sensors to
help regulate the climate settings in the vehicle.

Location of the sensors

```
Humidity sensor - in the rearview mirror con-
sole.
Ambient temperature sensor - in the right-
side door mirror.
Sunlight sensors - on the upper side of the
dashboard.
Passenger compartment temperature sensor
```
- near the buttons in the center console.

```
NOTE
Do not cover or block the sensors with cloth-
ing or other objects.
```
```
On vehicles equipped with the Interior Air Quality
System*, there is also an air quality sensor in the
climate system's air intake.
```
```
Related information
```
- Climate (p. 196)
- Interior Air Quality System* (p. 200)

```
Perceived temperature
The climate control system regulates the climate
in the passenger compartment based on per-
ceived temperature, not actual temperature.
```
```
The selected passenger compartment tempera-
ture is based on the physical perception of the
current ambient temperature, airflow speed,
humidity, sunlight in the passenger compartment,
etc.
The system has a sunlight sensor that detects
which side of the vehicle the sunlight is shining
on and adjusts the temperature accordingly. This
means that the temperature of the air coming out
of the vents may be different for the left and right
sides, even if the temperature setting is the same
for both sides.

Air quality
The materials used in the passenger compart-
ment and air filtering system have been selected
to ensure a high level of air quality in the passen-
ger compartment.

Materials used in the passenger
compartment
The materials in the passenger compartment are
designed to be pleasant and comfortable, even
for people with asthma or allergies.

The materials have been developed and tested to
minimize dust in the passenger compartment and
make it easier to keep clean.

The mats in both the passenger compartment
and trunk can be easily removed for cleaning.

Use Volvo-recommended cleaning agents and
car care products to clean the interior.

Air filtering systems
In addition to the passenger compartment filter,
the Clean Zone Interior Package* and Interior Air
Quality System* also help maintain high air qual-
ity in the passenger compartment.

CZIP includes the following:
```
- An enhanced function that starts the blower
    when the vehicle is unlocked using the
    remote key. The blower will then fill the pas-
    senger compartment with fresh air. The func-
    tion starts when required and switches off
    automatically after a period of time or when
    one of the passenger compartment doors is
    opened. The amount of time the blower runs
    gradually decreases due to reduced need up
    until the vehicle is 4 years old.
- The fully automatic Interior Air Quality
    System (IAQS).

Interior Air Quality System *
Interior Air Quality System (IAQS) is a fully auto-
matic air quality system that removes gases and
particles to reduce odors and contaminants in
the passenger compartment.
IAQS is part of the Clean Zone Interior Package
(CZIP) and removes air contaminants such as
particles, hydrocarbons, nitric oxides and ground-
level ozone.
If the system's air quality sensors detect contami-
nants in the outside air, the air intake closes and
air recirculation is activated.
```
```
NOTE
To ensure optimal air quality in the passenger
compartment, the air quality sensor should
always be engaged.
Recirculation is limited in cold weather to pre-
vent fogging.
In the event of fogging, use the defroster
functions for the windshield, side windows
and rear window.

Speed-dependent steering wheel
resistance
Speed-dependent power steering increases the
steering wheel resistance in pace with the vehi-
cle's speed to give the driver an enhanced feel-
ing of control and stability.
```
```
Steering may feel stiffer on highways. When
parking and at low speeds, it will be easier to
move the steering wheel.
```
```
NOTE
In some situations, the power steering may
become too hot and require temporary cool-
ing – during such time the power steering will
work at reduced output and the steering
wheel may feel more difficult to move.
In parallel with the temporarily reduced steer-
ing assistance, the driver display shows a
message as well as a STEERING WHEEL
symbol.
```

WARNING
While the power steering is working at
reduced power, the driver support functions
with steering assistance are not available.
In such a situation, the driver display shows
the Power steering failure or Power
Steering Assist Temporarily Reduced
message, combined with a STEERING
WHEEL symbol.
```
Changing the level of steering wheel
resistance*
To change the level of steering wheel resistance,
see the description of the INDIVIDUAL option
under "Available drive modes" in the "Drive
modes" section.

trols and the INDIVIDUAL option, steering wheel
resistance can instead be set in the center dis-

Stability system Roll Stability
Control
The Roll Stability Control (RSC^1 ) system helps
minimize the risk of a rollover in the event of e.g.
a sudden evasive maneuver or if the vehicle
begins to skid.
```
```
The RSC system monitors the lateral angle at
which the vehicle is leaning and registers any
changes. Using this information, the system cal-
culates the likelihood of a rollover. If there is an
imminent risk of a rollover, Electronic Stability
Control is activated, engine torque is reduced and
brakes are applied to one or more of the wheels
until the vehicle has regained stability.
```
```
WARNING
The vehicle’s stability systems, including RSC
do not replace the driver’s responsibility for
operating the vehicle in a safe manner. Speed
and driving style should always be adapted to
the current road, traffic and weather condi-
tions. Posted speed limits should always be
respected.

Electronic Stability Control
The Electronic Stability Control (ESC^2 ) function
helps the driver avoid skidding and improves the
vehicle's directional stability.
```
```
This symbol will be displayed in
the instrument panel when the
ESC system is intervening.
When the ESC has intervened
to apply the brakes, a pulsing
sound may be heard and the
vehicle may accelerate more slowly than expec-
ted when the accelerator pedal is depressed.
The ESC system consists of the following sub-
functions:
```
- Stability control^3
- Spin control and active yaw control
- Engine drag control

```
WARNING
```
- The Electronic Stability Control system
    ESC is supplementary driver support
    intended to facilitate driving and make it
    safer – it cannot handle all situations in
    all traffic, weather and road conditions.
- ESC is not a substitute for the driver's
    attention and judgment. The driver is
    always responsible for ensuring the vehi-
    cle is driven in a safe manner, at the
    appropriate speed, with an appropriate
    distance to other vehicles, and in accord-

    tions.

```
Stability control^3
This function helps control the driving and brak-
ing force of each individual wheel in an attempt
to stabilize the vehicle.
```
```
Spin control and active yaw control
This function is active at low speeds and brakes
the wheels that are spinning to transfer additional
power from wheels that are not spinning.
This function also helps prevent the wheels from
spinning while the vehicle is accelerating.
```
```
Engine drag control
Engine drag control (EDC^4 ) helps prevent inad-
vertent wheel lock, e.g. after downshifting or
using engine braking when driving at low speeds
on a slippery surface.
Inadvertent wheel lock while driving could impair
the driver's ability to steer the vehicle.

With the ESC Sport Mode sub-function
selected, intervention from ESC is reduced and
more lateral movement is permitted, giving the
driver more control of the vehicle than usual.

When ESC Sport Mode is selected, ESC may
seem to be disabled even though it is often

       released.
       For vehicles with both CC and ACC
       - Change a set speed by pressing the (1)
          or (3) buttons briefly or by pressing and
          holding them:
          - Press briefly: Press briefly: each press

             the set speed indicator (4) has moved to
             the desired speed.
       - The most recently set speed will be stored.
       If speed is increased by depressing the accelera-
       tor pedal while pressing the (1) button on
       the steering wheel, the vehicle's speed when the
       button is pressed will be stored as the set speed.
       Temporarily increasing speed using the accelera-
       tor pedal, e.g. when passing another vehicle, will

```
not affect the setting. The vehicle will return to
the set speed when the accelerator pedal is
released.
```
```
Using engine braking instead of
applying the brakes
Cruise Control regulates speed by lightly applying
the brakes. On downgrades, it can sometimes be
desirable to roll a bit faster and let speed be
reduced instead by engine braking alone. The
driver can temporarily disengage the Cruise Con-
trol braking function.
To disengage CC:
```
- Press the accelerator pedal about halfway
    down and then release it.
    > Cruise Control will automatically disen-
       gage the automatic brake function and
       speed will only be reduced using the
       engine braking function.

Cruise Control Eco Cruise
In the ECO drive mode, cruise control's accelera-
tion and deceleration will be smoother than in
other drive modes to help provide optimal fuel
efficiency and reduced environmental impact.
Because of this, the vehicle's actual speed may
be slightly above or below the set speed.

    vehicle later than expected or not detect
    other vehicles at all.
- The radar sensor cannot cover all driving
    situations and traffic, weather and road
    conditions.
- The driver is responsible for maintaining a
    safe distance and speed and must inter-
    vene if the various driver support systems
    do not maintain a suitable speed or suita-
    ble distance to the vehicle ahead.
- Maintenance of radar sensor components
    may only be performed by a trained and
    qualified Volvo technician.
- Strong sunlight, reflections from the road
    surface, strong lighting contrasts or using
    sunglasses may make the warning light in
    the windshield difficult to see. Poor
    weather or winding roads can affect the
    radar sensor's capacity to detect vehicles

Adaptive Cruise Control helps provide a more
relaxed driving experience on long trips on high-
ways or long, straight roads with even traffic
flows.
```
```
The camera/radar sensor measures the distance to the

The driver sets a speed and a time interval to the
vehicle ahead. If the camera/radar sensor detects
a slower-moving vehicle ahead, your vehicle's
speed will be automatically adapted according to
the set time interval to that vehicle. When there
```
```
are no longer slower-moving vehicles ahead, the
vehicle will return to the set speed.
```
```
WARNING
```
- The Adaptive Cruise Control function is
    supplementary driver support intended to
    facilitate driving and help make it safer –
    it cannot handle all situations in all traffic,
    weather and road conditions.
- The driver is advised to read all sections
    in the Owner's Manual about this function
    to learn of its limitations, which the driver
    must be aware of before using the func-
    tion (see the link list at the end of this
    article).
- Adaptive Cruise Control is not a substi-
    tute for the driver's attention and judg-
    ment. The driver is always responsible for
    ensuring the vehicle is driven in a safe
    manner, at the appropriate speed, with an
    appropriate distance to other vehicles,
    and in accordance with current traffic
    rules and regulations.

## DRIVER SUPPORT

 

```
285
```
Adaptive Cruise Control regulates speed by
accelerating and braking. It is normal for the
brakes to emit a slight sound when they are
being used to adjust speed.

Adaptive Cruise Control always attempts to regu-
late speed smoothly. The driver must apply the
brakes in situations requiring immediate braking.
For example, when there are great differences in
speed between vehicles or if the vehicle ahead
brakes suddenly. Due to limitations in the radar
sensor, braking may occur unexpectedly or not at
all.

Adaptive Cruise Control is designed to follow a
vehicle ahead in the same lane and maintain a
time interval to that vehicle set by the driver. If the
radar sensor does not detect a vehicle ahead, it
will instead maintain the speed set by the driver.
This will also happen if the speed of the vehicle
ahead exceeds the set speed for your vehicle.

- Adaptive Cruise Control can follow another
    vehicle at speeds from a standstill up to
    200 km/h (125 mph).

```
WARNING
```
- Adaptive Cruise Control is not a collision
    avoidance system. The driver is always
    responsible and must intervene if the sys-
    tem fails to detect a vehicle ahead.
- Adaptive Cruise Control does not brake
    for people or animals and does not brake
    for small vehicles, such as bikes and
    motorcycles. Similarly, it does not brake
    for low trailers, oncoming, slow-moving or
    stationary vehicles and objects.
- Do not use Adaptive Cruise Control in
    demanding situations, such as in city traf-
    fic, at intersections, on slippery surfaces,
    with a lot of water or slush on the road, in
    heavy rain/snow, in poor visibility, on
    winding roads, or on on/off ramps.

Maintenance of Adaptive Cruise Control com-
ponents may only be performed by a work-
shop – an authorized Volvo workshop is rec-
ommended.

Standby mode due to action by the driver
Adaptive Cruise Control will be temporarily deac-
tivated and put in standby mode if:
```
- the brakes are applied.
- the gear selector is moved to N
- the vehicle is driven faster than the set
    speed for more than 1 minute
Temporarily increasing speed using the accelera-
tor pedal, e.g. when passing another vehicle, will
not affect the setting. The vehicle will return to
the set speed when the accelerator pedal is
released.
Automatic standby mode
Adaptive Cruise Control is dependent on other
systems, such as Electronic Stability Control
(ESC^46 ). If any of these other systems stops
working, Adaptive Cruise Control will automati-
cally switch off.

```
WARNING
With automatic standby mode, the driver is
warned by an acoustic signal and a message
on the instrument panel.
```
- The driver must then regulate vehicle
    speed, apply the brakes if necessary, and
    maintain a safe distance to other vehicles.

```
Adaptive Cruise Control may go into standby
mode if:
```
- your vehicle's speed goes below 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and ACC cannot determine if the
    vehicle ahead is stationary or if it is another
    object, e.g. a speed bump.
- your vehicle's speed goes under 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and the vehicle ahead turns so that
    ACC no longer has a vehicle to follow.
- the driver opens the door.
- the driver unbuckles the seat belt.
- the engine speed (rpm) is too low/high.
- one or more of the wheels lose traction.
- the brake temperature is high.
- the parking brake is applied.
- the camera/radar sensor is covered by snow
    or heavy rain (the camera lens/radar waves
    are blocked)

```

Passing assistance with Adaptive
Cruise Control

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC^47 ) can assist the
driver when passing other vehicles.

How passing assistance works
When ACC is following another vehicle and you
indicate that you intend to pass that vehicle by
using the turn signal^48 , Adaptive Cruise Control
will begin accelerating toward the vehicle ahead
before your vehicle has moved into the passing
lane.

The function will then delay a speed reduction to
avoid early braking as your vehicle approaches a
slower-moving vehicle.

The function remains active until your vehicle has
passed the other vehicle.

```
WARNING
Please note that this function can be acti-
vated in more situations than just passing
another vehicle, such as when a direction indi-
cator is used to indicate a lane change or
before exiting to another road – the vehicle
will then briefly accelerate.
```

```
Starting passing assistance with
Adaptive Cruise Control
```
```
Requirements for passing assistance
In order to activate passing assistance:
```
- your vehicle must be following a vehicle
    ahead (target vehicle)
- your vehicle's current speed must be
    at least 70 km/h (43 mph)
- the set speed for ACC must be high
    enough to safely pass another vehicle.

```
Starting parking assistance
To start passing assistance:
```
- Turn on the left turn signal.
    > Passing assistance will start.

```
Related information
```
- Adaptive Cruise Control* (p. 284)

```
Limitations of passing assistance
with Adaptive Cruise Control
Passing assistance functionality may be reduced
in certain situations.
WARNING
The driver should be aware that if conditions
suddenly change when using Parking Assis-
tance, the function may implement an unde-
sired acceleration in certain conditions.
Some situations should be avoided, e.g. if:
```
- the vehicle is approaching an exit in the
    same direction as passing would normally
    occur
- the vehicle ahead slows before your vehi-
    cle has had time to switch to the passing
    lane
- traffic in the passing lane slows down
- a vehicle for right-hand traffic is driven in
    a country with left-hand traffic (or vice
    versa).

```
Situations of this type can be avoided by tempo-
rarily putting ACC^49 in standby mode.

Switching target vehicles with
Adaptive Cruise Control
At certain speeds, models with automatic trans-
missions and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC^50 )
can switch target vehicles.
```
```
Switching target vehicles
```
```
If the target vehicle ahead turns suddenly, there may be
stationary traffic ahead.
When Adaptive Cruise Control is actively follow-
ing another vehicle at speeds under 30 km/h
(20 mph) and switches targets from a moving
vehicle to a stationary vehicle, Adaptive Cruise
Control will brake for the stationary vehicle.
```
```
WARNING
When Adaptive Cruise Control follows another
vehicle at speeds over approx. 30 km/h
(20 mph) and changes target vehicle – from a
moving vehicle to a stationary one – Adaptive
Cruise Control will ignore the stationary vehi-
cle and instead accelerate to the stored
speed.
```
- The driver must then intervene and apply
    the brakes.

```
Automatic standby mode when switching
targets
Adaptive Cruise Control will be disabled and go
into standby mode:
```
- if your vehicle's speed goes below 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and Adaptive Cruise Control cannot
    determine if the target object is a stationary
    vehicle or another object, e.g. a speed bump.
- if your vehicle's speed goes under 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and the vehicle ahead turns so that
    Adaptive Cruise Control no longer has a vehi-
    cle to follow.

cial brake function in slow traffic and while sta-
tionary.
```
```
Braking function in slow traffic and at a
standstill
In slow-moving, stop-and-go traffic or when stop-
ped at a traffic light, driving will resume automati-
cally if the vehicle is stopped for less than
approx. 3 seconds. If it takes more than 3 sec-
onds for the vehicle ahead to begin moving again,
Adaptive Cruise Control will go into standby
mode and the Auto-hold brake function will acti-
vate.
```
- Adaptive Cruise Control can be reactivated in
    one of the following ways:
    - Pressing the button on the steering
       wheel keypad.
    - Pressing the accelerator pedal.
    > Adaptive Cruise Control will resume fol-
       lowing the vehicle ahead if it begins to
       move within approx. 6 seconds.

NOTE
ACC can keep the vehicle stationary for no
more than 5 minutes – after that time the
parking brake is applied and Adaptive Cruise
Control is deactivated.
The parking brake must be released before
Adaptive Cruise Control can be reactivated.
```
Deactivation of the Auto-hold brake function
In certain situations, Auto-hold will be deactivated
when the vehicle is at a standstill and Adaptive
Cruise Control will go into standby mode. This
means that the brakes will be released and the
vehicle could begin to roll. The driver must
actively apply the brakes to keep the vehicle sta-
tionary.

This can occur if:

- the driver depresses the brake pedal
- the parking brake is applied
- the gear selector is moved to the P, N or R
    positions
- the driver puts Adaptive Cruise Control in
    standby mode.

Auto Activate Parking Brake
In certain situations, the parking brake will be
applied to keep the vehicle at a standstill.

```
This occurs if Adaptive Cruise Control is keeping
the vehicle stationary using the brakes and:
```
- the driver opens the door or unbuckles
    his/her seat belt
- ACC has kept the vehicle at a standstill for
    more than approx. 5 minutes
- the brakes overheat
- the driver switches off the engine manually.

Steep roads and/or heavy loads
Adaptive Cruise Control is primarily intended to
be driven on flat roads. The function may not be
able to maintain the correct time interval to the
vehicle ahead when driving down steep hills. The
driver should be extra attentive and prepared to
apply the brakes.
```
- Do not use Adaptive Cruise Control if the
    vehicle is carrying a heavy load or towing a
    trailer.

```
Other limitations
```
- The Off Road drive mode cannot be
    selected if Adaptive Cruise Control is acti-
    vated.

Pilot Assist
Pilot Assist helps the driver keep the vehicle in
the current traffic lane by providing steering
assistance and maintaining an even speed and a
set time interval to the vehicle ahead.
```
```
How Pilot Assist works
The Pilot Assist function is primarily intended for
use on highways and other major roads where it
can help provide a more comfortable and relaxing
driving experience.
```
```
The camera/radar sensor monitors the distance to the
vehicle ahead and detects lane markings^58.
Camera and radar sensor
```
```
Distance monitor
```
```
Lane marker line monitors
```
```
The driver sets the desired speed and distance to
the vehicle ahead. Pilot Assist monitors the dis-
tance to the vehicle ahead and the traffic lane's
side markers using the camera and radar sensor.
The system maintains the set time interval to the
vehicle ahead by automatically adjusting your
vehicle's speed and keeps your vehicle in its lane
by providing steering assistance.
Pilot Assist's steering assistance is based on
monitoring the direction of the vehicle ahead and
the traffic lane's side marker lines. The driver can
override Pilot Assist's steering recommendations
at any time and steer in another direction, e.g. to
change lanes or avoid obstacles on the road.
If the camera/radar sensor cannot detect the
lane's side marker lines or if Pilot Assist is unable
for some other reason to clearly interpret the
lane, Pilot Assist will temporarily deactivate steer-
ing assistance until it can once again interpret
the lane markings. However, the speed and dis-
tance warnings will remain active.
```
```
WARNING
Pilot Assist is deactivated automatically and
resumes working without prior notice.
```
```
The color of the steering wheel
symbol indicates the current
status of steering assistance:
```
- GREEN indicates that steer-
ing assistance is active
- GRAY (as shown in illustra-
tion) indicates that steering assistance is deacti-
vated.

(^58) Note: This illustration is general and details may vary depending on model.


## DRIVER SUPPORT

301
```
```
WARNING
```
- The Pilot Assist function is supplementary
    driver support intended to facilitate driv-
    ing and help make it safer – it cannot
    handle all situations in all traffic, weather
    and road conditions.
- The driver is advised to read all sections
    in the Owner's Manual about this function
    to learn of its limitations, which the driver
    must be aware of before using the func-
    tion (see the link list at the end of this
    article).
- Pilot Assist should only be used if there
    are clear lane lines painted on each side
    of the lane. All other use will increase the
    risk of contact with nearby obstacles that
    cannot be detected by the functions.
- Pilot Assist is not a substitute for the driv-
    er's attention and judgment. The driver is
    always responsible for ensuring the vehi-
    cle is driven in a safe manner, at the
    proper position within the lane, at the
    appropriate speed, with an appropriate
    distance to other vehicles, and in accord-
    ance with current traffic rules and regula-
    tions.

```
NOTE
Depending on market, this function may be
either Standard or Optional.
```
```
Pilot Assist regulates speed by accelerating and
braking. It is normal for the brakes to emit a slight
sound when they are being used to adjust speed.
Pilot Assist attempts to smoothly regulate speed.
The driver must apply the brakes in situations
requiring immediate braking. For example, when
there are great differences in speed between
vehicles or if the vehicle ahead brakes suddenly.
Due to limitations in the camera and radar sen-
sor, braking may occur unexpectedly or not at all.
Pilot Assist is designed to follow a vehicle ahead
in the same lane and maintain a time interval to
that vehicle set by the driver. If the radar sensor
does not detect a vehicle ahead, it will instead
maintain the speed set by the driver. This will also
happen if the speed of the vehicle ahead
exceeds the set speed for your vehicle.
```
- Pilot Assist can follow another vehicle at
    speeds from a standstill up to 200 km/h
    (125 mph).
- Pilot Assist can provide steering assistance
    from near-stationary speeds up to 140 km/h
    (87 mph).

```
WARNING
```
- Pilot Assist is not a collision avoidance
    system. The driver must intervene if the
    system fails to detect a vehicle ahead.
- Pilot Assist does not brake for people,
    animals, objects, small vehicles (e.g.
    cycles and motorcycles), low trailers as
    well as oncoming, slow or stationary vehi-
    cles.
- Do not use Pilot Assist in demanding sit-
    uations, such as in city traffic, at intersec-
    tions, on slippery surfaces, with a lot of
    water or slush on the road, in heavy rain/
    snow, in poor visibility, on winding roads,
    on highway on- or off-ramps, or with a
    trailer connected to the vehicle.

```
CAUTION
Maintenance of the integrated components in
Pilot Assist may only be performed by a work-
shop – an authorized Volvo workshop is rec-
ommended.
```
```
In curves and forks in the road
Pilot Assist is designed to interact with the driver.
The driver should never wait for steering assis-
tance from Pilot Assist, but instead should always
be ready to increase his or her own steering
efforts, particularly in curves.
```

## ||

## DRIVER SUPPORT

302

```
When the vehicle is approaching an off-ramp or a
fork in the road, the driver should steer toward
the desired lane to indicate to Pilot Assist the
desired direction of travel.
```
```
Pilot Assist strives to keep the vehicle
in the center of the lane
When Pilot Assist provides steering assistance, it
strives to position the vehicle in the center of the
lane between the lane markings. For the smooth-
est driving experience possible, the driver should
permit the vehicle to find the optimal positioning.
The driver should check that the vehicle is posi-
tioned safely in the lane and can always adjust
the vehicle's position by applying more force to
the steering wheel.
If Pilot Assist does not position the vehicle appro-
priately in the lane, the driver should turn off Pilot
Assist or switch to Adaptive Cruise Control.

vehicle, ACC can monitor that vehicle's speed
and slow your own vehicle down to a standstill,
but it is not possible to set speeds lower than
30 km/h (20 mph).

```
The highest possible speed that can be set is
200 km/h (125 mph).

Setting a time interval for Pilot
Assist
Pilot Assist can be set to different time intervals.
```
```
Different time intervals to the
vehicle ahead can be selected
and are shown in the instru-
ment panel as 1–5 horizontal
bars. The more bars, the longer
the time interval. One bar rep-
resents an interval of
approx. 1 second to the vehicle ahead. 5 bars
represents approx. 3 seconds.
```
```
NOTE
When the symbol in the instrument panel
shows a vehicle and a steering wheel, Pilot
Assist follows a vehicle ahead at a preset
time interval.
When only a steering wheel is shown, there is
no vehicle ahead within a reasonable dis-
tance.

    increase the time interval.
    > The distance indicator (3) shows the cur-
       rent time interval.

In order to follow the vehicle ahead as smoothly
as possible, Pilot Assist allows the time interval to
vary considerably in certain situations. For exam-
ple, at low speeds and short distances to the
vehicle ahead, Pilot Assist increases the time
interval slightly.

```
NOTE
```
- The greater the vehicles' speed, the
    greater the distance between them for a
    set time interval.
- Only use the time intervals permitted by
    local traffic regulations.
- If Pilot Assist does not seem to respond
    with a speed increase when activated, it
    may be because the time interval to the
    vehicle ahead is shorter than the set time
    interval.

```
WARNING
```
- Only use a time interval suitable for the
    current traffic conditions.
- The driver should be aware that short
    time intervals give them limited time to
    react and act to any unforeseen traffic
    situation.

```
Setting how Pilot Assist should
maintain distance* to the vehicle ahead
The driver can choose different drive modes to
determine how Pilot Assist should maintain a
time interval to the vehicle ahead. Settings are
made using the DRIVE MODE controls.
```
```
Select one of the following:
```
- Eco - Pilot Assist will focus on providing
    optimal fuel economy, which will increase the
    time interval to the vehicle ahead.
- Comfort - Pilot Assist will focus on following
    the set time interval to the vehicle ahead as
    smoothly as possible.
- Dynamic - Pilot Assist will focus on follow-
    ing the set time interval to the vehicle ahead
    more exactly, which could mean faster accel-
    eration and heavier braking.
For more information, see "Drive modes".

Automatic standby mode
Pilot Assist is dependent on other systems, such
as Electronic Stability Control (ESC^62 ). If any of
these other systems stops working, Pilot Assist
will automatically switch off.

```
WARNING
With automatic standby mode, the driver is
warned by an acoustic signal and a message
on the instrument panel.
```
- The driver must then regulate vehicle
    speed, apply the brakes if necessary, and
    maintain a safe distance to other vehicles.

Adaptive Cruise Control may go into standby
mode if, e.g.:

- the driver opens the door.
- the brake temperature is high.
- the driver's hands are not on the steering
    wheel.
- the parking brake is applied.
- the engine speed (rpm) is too low/high.
- the driver unbuckles the seat belt.
- one or more of the wheels lose traction.
- the camera/radar sensor is covered by snow
    or heavy rain (the camera lens/radar waves
    are blocked)
       - your vehicle's speed goes below 5 km/h
          (3 mph) and Pilot Assist cannot determine if
          the vehicle ahead is stationary or if it is
          another object, e.g. a speed bump.
       - your vehicle's speed goes under 5 km/h
          (3 mph) and the vehicle ahead turns so that
          Pilot Assist no longer has a vehicle to follow.

Passing assistance with Pilot Assist
Pilot Assist can assist the driver when passing
other vehicles.
```
```
How passing assistance works
When Pilot Assist is following another vehicle
and you indicate that you intend to pass that
vehicle by using the turn signal^63 , Pilot Assist will
begin accelerating toward the vehicle ahead
before your vehicle has moved into the passing
lane.
The function will then delay a speed reduction to
avoid early braking as your vehicle approaches a
slower-moving vehicle.
The function remains active until your vehicle has
passed the other vehicle.
```
```
WARNING
Please note that this function can be acti-
vated in more situations than just passing
another vehicle, such as when a direction indi-
cator is used to indicate a lane change or
before exiting to another road – the vehicle
will then briefly accelerate.
```
```

Pilot Assist
```
```
Requirements for passing assistance
In order to activate passing assistance:
```
- your vehicle must be following a vehicle
    ahead (target vehicle)
- your vehicle's current speed must be
    at least 70 km/h (43 mph)
- the set speed for Pilot Assist must be high
    enough to safely pass another vehicle.

```
Starting parking assistance
To start passing assistance:
```
- Turn on the left turn signal.
    > Passing assistance will start.

```

```
Passing assistance with Pilot Assist
limitations
Passing assistance functionality may be reduced
in certain situations.
WARNING
The driver should be aware that if conditions
suddenly change when using Parking Assis-
tance, the function may implement an unde-
sired acceleration in certain conditions.
Some situations should be avoided, e.g. if:
```
- the vehicle is approaching an exit in the
    same direction as passing would normally
    occur
- the vehicle ahead slows before your vehi-
    cle has had time to switch to the passing
    lane
- traffic in the passing lane slows down
- a vehicle for right-hand traffic is driven in
    a country with left-hand traffic (or vice
    versa).

```
Situations of this type can be avoided by tempo-
rarily putting Pilot Assist in standby mode.
```

Switching target vehicles with Pilot
Assist
At certain speeds, models with automatic trans-
missions and Pilot Assist can switch target vehi-
cles.

Switching target vehicles

If the target vehicle ahead turns suddenly, there may be
stationary traffic ahead.

When Pilot Assist is actively following another
vehicle at speeds under 30 km/h (20 mph) and
switches targets from a moving vehicle to a sta-
tionary vehicle, Pilot Assist will brake for the sta-
tionary vehicle.

```
WARNING
When Pilot Assist follows another vehicle at
speeds over approx. 30 km/h (20 mph) and
changes target vehicle – from a moving vehi-
cle to a stationary one – Pilot Assist will
ignore the stationary vehicle and instead
accelerate to the stored speed.
```
- The driver must then intervene and apply
    the brakes.

```
Automatic standby mode when switching
targets
Pilot Assist disengages and goes into standby
mode if:
```
- your vehicle's speed goes below 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and Pilot Assist cannot determine if
    the target object is a stationary vehicle or
    another object, e.g. a speed bump.
- your vehicle's speed goes under 5 km/h
    (3 mph) and the vehicle ahead turns so that
    Pilot Assist no longer has a vehicle to follow.

```

```
Automatic braking with Pilot Assist
Pilot Assist has a special braking function in
slow traffic and at a standstill.
```
```
Braking function in slow traffic and at a
standstill
In slow-moving, stop-and-go traffic or when stop-
ped at a traffic light, driving will resume automati-
cally if the vehicle is stopped for less than
approx. 3 seconds. If it takes more than 3 sec-
onds for the vehicle ahead to begin moving again,
Pilot Assist will go into standby mode and the
Auto-hold brake function will activate.
```
- Pilot Assist can be reactivated by:
    - Pressing the button on the steering
       wheel keypad.
    - Pressing the accelerator pedal.
    > Pilot Assist will resume following the vehi-
       cle ahead if it begins to move within
       approx. 6 seconds.

```
NOTE
Pilot Assist can keep the vehicle stationary
for no more than 5 minutes – after that time
the parking brake is applied and the function
is deactivated.
The parking brake must be released before
Pilot Assist can be reactivated.
```

## ||

## DRIVER SUPPORT

312

```
Deactivation of the Auto-hold brake function
In certain situations, Auto-hold will be deactivated
when the vehicle is at a standstill and Pilot Assist
will go into standby mode. This means that the
brakes will be released and the vehicle could
begin to roll. The driver must actively apply the
brakes to keep the vehicle stationary.
This can occur if:
```
- the driver depresses the brake pedal
- the parking brake is applied
- the gear selector is moved to the P, N or R
    positions
- the driver puts Pilot Assist in standby mode.

```
Auto Activate Parking Brake
In certain situations, the parking brake will be
applied to keep the vehicle at a standstill.
This occurs if Pilot Assist is keeping the vehicle
stationary using the brakes and:
```
- the driver opens the door or unbuckles
    his/her seat belt
- Pilot Assist has kept the vehicle at a stand-
    still for more than approx. 5 minutes
- the brakes overheat
- the driver switches off the engine manually.

Pilot Assist limitations
Pilot Assist functionality may be reduced in cer-
tain situations.
```
```
Pilot Assist is a driver support function designed
to simplify driving and assist the driver in many
situations. However, the driver is always responsi-
ble for maintaining a suitable distance to vehicles
or objects around it and ensuring that the vehicle
is correctly positioned in the traffic lane.
```
```
WARNING
In some situations, Pilot Assist may have trou-
ble helping the driver properly or may be
deactivated automatically – we advise against
using Pilot Assist in such cases. Examples of
such situations include:
```
- the lane markings are worn, missing or
    cross each other.
- lane division is unclear, for example, when
    the lanes divide or merge or at exits or
    when there are multiple sets of markings.
- edges or other lines than lane markings
    are present on or near the road, e.g.
    curbs, joints or repairs to the road sur-
    face, edges of barriers, roadside edges or
    strong shadows.
- the lane is narrow or winding.
- the lane contains ridges or holes.
- weather conditions are poor, e.g. rain,
    snow or fog or slush or reduced visibility
    with poor light conditions, backlighting,
    wet road surface, etc.
The driver should also note that Pilot Assist
has the following limitations:
- High curbs, roadside barriers, temporary
    obstacles (traffic cones, safety barriers,
    etc.) are not detected. Alternatively, they
    may be detected incorrectly as lane mark-
    ings, with a subsequent risk of contact
    between the vehicle and such obstacles.


## DRIVER SUPPORT

 

```
* Option/accessory. 313
```
```
The driver is responsible for ensuring that
the vehicle maintains a suitable distance
from such obstacles.
```
- The camera and radar sensors do not
    have the capacity to detect all oncoming
    objects and obstacles in traffic environ-
    ments, e.g. potholes, stationary obstacles
    or objects that completely or partially
    block the route.
- Pilot Assist does not "see" pedestrians,
    animals, etc.
- The recommended steering input is lim-
    ited in force, which means that it cannot
    always help the driver to steer and keep
    the vehicle within the lane.
- Pilot Assist is switched off if the power
    steering is working with reduced power -
    e.g. during cooling due to overheating
    (see section "Speed-dependent steering
    force").

The driver can always correct or adjust steering
assistance provided by Pilot Assist by turning the
steering wheel to the desired position.

Steep roads and/or heavy loads
Pilot Assist is primarily intended to be driven on
flat roads. The function may not be able to main-
tain the correct time interval to the vehicle ahead
when driving down steep hills. The driver should

```
be extra attentive and prepared to apply the
brakes.
```
- Do not use Pilot Assist if the vehicle is carry-
    ing a heavy load or towing a trailer.

```
NOTE
Pilot Assist cannot be activated if a trailer,
bike carrier or similar is connected to the
vehicle electrical system.
```
```
Other limitations
```
- The Off Road drive mode cannot be
    selected when Pilot Assist is activated.

```
NOTE
The function uses the vehicle's camera unit,
which has some general limitations – see the
section "Camera unit limitations".
```

```
Vehicle speed
The radar sensor's ability to detect a vehicle
ahead is significantly reduced if:

- the speed of the vehicle ahead differs greatly
    from your vehicle's speed

Limited field of vision
The radar sensor has a limited field of vision. In
some situations, it may detect a vehicle later than
expected or not at all.

```
The radar sensor's field of vision.
The radar sensor's detection of vehicles very
close to your vehicle may be delayed in cer-
tain situations, e.g. if a vehicle pulls in
```
```
between your vehicle and the vehicle directly
ahead.
Small vehicles, such as motorcycles, or vehi-
cles that are not driving in the center of the
lane may remain undetected.
In curves, the radar may detect the wrong
vehicle or lose sight of a target vehicle.
Low trailers
```
```
Low trailer in the radar shadow.
Low trailers may also be difficult or even impossi-
ble for the radar to detect. The driver should be

High temperatures
If the temperature in the passenger compartment
is very high, the camera/radar sensor will switch
off temporarily for approx. 15 minutes after the
engine is started to protect its electronic compo-
nents. When the temperature has cooled suffi-
ciently, the camera/radar sensor will automati-
cally restart.
```

Damaged windshield
```
```
CAUTION
If there are cracks, scratches or stone chips
on the windshield in front of any of the cam-
era and radar unit "windows" and this covers
an area of about 0.5 × 3.0 mm
(0.02 × 0.12 in.) or more, contact a workshop
to have the windshield replaced – an author-
ized Volvo workshop is recommended.
Failure to take action could result in reduced
performance for the driver support systems
that use the camera and radar unit.
It could cause functions to be reduced, deac-
tivated completely or produce an incorrect
function response.
To avoid the risk of loss of function, malfunc-
tion or reduced function of the driver support
systems that use the radar unit, the following
also apply:
```
- Volvo advises against repairing cracks,
    scratches or stone chips in the area in
    front of the camera and radar unit – the
    entire windshield should instead be
    replaced.
- Before replacing the windshield, contact
    an authorized Volvo workshop to verify
    that the right windshield has been
    ordered and installed.
       - The same type of windshield wipers or
          wipers approved by Volvo should be used
          for replacement.

```
CAUTION
If the windshield is replaced, the camera and
radar unit must be recalibrated by a workshop
to help ensure proper functioning of all of the
vehicle's camera and radar-based systems –
an authorized Volvo workshop is recom-
mended.

Camera limitations
The camera used by several of the driver support
functions has certain limitations, which also
affect the functions using the camera.

Reduced visibility
The camera has the same limitations as the
human eye. In other words, its “vision" is impaired
by adverse weather conditions such as heavy
snowfall/rain, dense fog, swirling dust/snow, etc.
These conditions may reduce the function of sys-
tems that depend on the camera or cause these
systems to temporarily stop functioning.

Strong sunlight, reflections from the road surface,
ice or snow covering the road, a dirty road sur-
face, or unclear lane marker lines may drastically
reduce the camera’s ability to detect the side of a
lane, a pedestrian, a cyclist, a large animal or
another vehicle.

```
Cause Action
The area of the windshield in front of the camera/radar sensor is
dirty or covered by ice or snow.
```
```
Clean the windshield in front of the camera/radar sensor and remove dirt, ice and
snow.
Thick fog, heavy rain or snow is blocking the radar signals or the
camera's range of visibility.
```
```
No action. Heavy precipitation may sometimes prevent the camera/radar sensor from
functioning.
```
```
Water or snow is spraying/swirling up and blocking the radar signals
or the camera's range of visibility.
```
```
No action. Very wet or snow-covered roads may sometimes prevent the camera/
radar sensor from functioning.
```
```
There is dirt between the inside of the windshield and the camera/
radar sensor.
```
```
Consult a workshop to have the area of the windshield on the inside of the camera's
casing cleaned. An authorized Volvo workshop is recommended.
```
```
Bright sunlight No action. The camera/radar sensor will reset automatically when lighting conditions
improve.
```
```
NOTE
Keep the windshield in front of the camera
and radar unit clean.
```
```
High temperatures
If the temperature in the passenger compartment
is very high, the camera/radar sensor will switch
off temporarily for approx. 15 minutes after the
engine is started to protect its electronic compo-
nents. When the temperature has cooled suffi-
ciently, the camera/radar sensor will automati-
cally restart.
```
```
Damaged windshield
```
```
CAUTION
If there are cracks, scratches or stone chips
on the windshield in front of any of the cam-
era and radar unit "windows" and this covers
an area of about 0.5 × 3.0 mm
(0.02 × 0.12 in.) or more, contact a workshop
to have the windshield replaced – an author-
ized Volvo workshop is recommended.
Failure to take action could result in reduced
performance for the driver support systems
that use the camera and radar unit.
```
```
It could cause functions to be reduced, deac-
tivated completely or produce an incorrect
function response.
To avoid the risk of loss of function, malfunc-
tion or reduced function of the driver support
systems that use the radar unit, the following
also apply:
```
- Volvo advises against repairing cracks,
    scratches or stone chips in the area in
    front of the camera and radar unit – the
    entire windshield should instead be
    replaced.
- Before replacing the windshield, contact
    an authorized Volvo workshop to verify


## DRIVER SUPPORT

```
323
```
```
that the right windshield has been
ordered and installed.
```
- The same type of windshield wipers or
    wipers approved by Volvo should be used
    for replacement.

```
CAUTION
If the windshield is replaced, the camera and
radar unit must be recalibrated by a workshop
to help ensure proper functioning of all of the
vehicle's camera and radar-based systems –
an authorized Volvo workshop is recom-
mended.

City Safety ™
City Safety can alert the driver with light, sound
and pulsations in the brake pedal to help the
driver detect pedestrians, cyclists, large animals
and vehicles that appear suddenly – the vehicle
will then attempt to automatically brake if the
driver does not act within a reasonable amount
of time.
```
```
Location of the camera and radar sensor^71.
City Safety can help prevent a collision or lower
the vehicle's speed at the point of impact.
City Safety is an aid intended to assist the driver
if a collision with a pedestrian, large animal,
cyclist or vehicle is imminent.
City Safety can help the driver avoid a collision
when e.g. driving in stop-and-go traffic, when
```
```
changes in the traffic ahead and driver distraction
could lead to an incident.
The function assists the driver by automatically
applying the brakes if there is an imminent risk of
a collision and the driver does not react in time by
braking and/or steering away.
City Safety activates a brief, forceful braking in an
attempt to stop your vehicle immediately behind
the vehicle or object ahead.
City Safety is activated in situations in which the
driver should have applied the brakes much ear-
lier, which means that the system will not be able
to assist the driver in all situations.
City Safety is designed to be activated as late as
possible to help avoid unnecessary intervention.
Normally, the occupants of the vehicle will not be
aware of City Safety except when the system
intervenes when a collision is imminent.

WARNING
```
- The City Safety function is supplementary
    driver support intended to help improve
    driving safety – it cannot handle all situa-
    tions in all traffic, weather and road condi-
    tions.
- The City Safety auto-brake function can
    prevent a collision or reduce collision
    speed, but to ensure full brake perform-
    ance the driver should always depress the
    brake pedal – even when the car auto-
    brakes.
- The warning and steering assistance are
    only activated if there is a high risk of col-
    lision – you must therefore never wait for
    the collision warning or City Safety to
    intervene.
- Warnings and brake interventions for
    pedestrians and cyclists are disengaged
    at vehicle speeds over 80 km/h
    (50 mph).
- City Safety does not activate auto-braking
    intervention during heavy acceleration.
- City Safety is not a substitute for the driv-
    er's attention and judgment. The driver is
    always responsible for ensuring the vehi-
    cle is driven in a safe manner, at the
    appropriate speed, with an appropriate
    distance to other vehicles, and in accord-
    ance with current traffic rules and regula-
    tions.
       - The driver is advised to read all sections
          in the Owner's Manual that relate to City
          Safety to learn about factors such as its
          limitations and what the driver should be
          aware of before using the system (see
          the list of links for all subsections).

City Safety parameters and sub-
functions
City Safety can help avoid a collision with a vehi-
cle, cyclist or large animal ahead by reducing the
vehicle's speed using its automatic braking func-
tion.
If the difference in speed is greater than the
speeds specified below, the City Safety auto-
brake function cannot prevent a collision, but it
can help mitigate its effects.
Vehicles
City Safety can help prevent a collision with a
vehicle ahead by reducing your vehicle's speed
by up to 60 km/h (37 mph).
Cyclists
City Safety can help prevent a collision with a
cyclist ahead by reducing your vehicle's speed by
up to 50 km/h (30 mph).
Pedestrians
City Safety can help prevent a collision with a
pedestrian ahead by reducing your vehicle's
speed by up to 45 km/h (28 mph).
```

## DRIVER SUPPORT

326

```
Large animals
If there is a risk of colliding with a large animal,
City Safety can help reduce your vehicle's speed
by up to 15 km/h (9 mph).
The braking function for large animals is primarily
intended to mitigate the force of a collision at
higher speeds. Braking is most effective at
speeds above 70 km/h (43 mph) and less effec-
tive at lower speeds.

```
Camera/radar sensor distance monitoring
```
```
City Safety carries out three steps in the follow-
ing order:
```
1. Collision warning
2. Brake assistance
3. Auto-brake
Descriptions of what happens in these three
steps are provided below.
1 - Collision warning
The driver is first alerted to the risk of an immi-
nent collision.
City Safety can detect pedestrians, cyclists or
vehicles that are stationary, are moving in the
same direction as your vehicle and are ahead of
your vehicle. City Safety can also detect pedes-
trians, cyclists or large animals that are crossing
the road in front of your vehicle.
If there is a risk of a collision with a pedestrian,
large animal, cyclist or another vehicle, or with a
vehicle described in the section "City Safety in
crossing traffic", the driver will be alerted with
light, sound and pulsations in the brake pedal. At
lower speeds, during hard braking or if the accel-
erator pedal is pressed, the brake pedal pulsation
warning will not be given. The intensity of the
brake pedal pulsations varies according to the
vehicle's speed.

```
2 - Brake assistance
If the risk of a collision increases after the colli-
sion warning, brake support will be activated.
If the system determines that the pressure the
driver is exerting on the brake pedal is insufficient
to prevent the collision, brake support will
increase pressure.
```
(^72) Note: This illustration is general and details may vary depending on model.


## DRIVER SUPPORT

 

```
327
```
3 - Auto-brake
The automatic braking function is activated at the
last moment.

If the driver has not taken evasive action by this
stage and a collision is imminent, the automatic
braking function will be triggered. This occurs
whether or not the driver is pressing the brake
pedal. Full braking force will be applied to reduce
the speed at impact or reduced braking effect will
be applied if this is sufficient to avoid the colli-
sion.

The seat belt tensioners may be activated along
with the automatic braking function. See "Seat
belt tensioners" for more information.

In certain situations, auto-braking may begin with
a limited braking force before applying full brak-
ing force.

If City Safety has prevented a collision, the vehi-
cle will be kept at a standstill until the driver
takes action. If the vehicle has slowed to avoid
colliding with a slower-moving vehicle ahead, your
speed will be reduced to that vehicle's speed.

Auto-braking can always be cancelled if the
driver presses hard on the accelerator pedal.

```
NOTE
When City Safety activates the brakes, the
brake lights come on.
```
```
When City Safety applies the brakes, a text mes-
sage will appear in the instrument panel to notify
the driver that the function is/was activated.
```
```
WARNING
City Safety may not be used to change how
the driver operates the vehicle. The driver
must not only rely on City Safety to brake the
vehicle.
```
```

```
- City Safety™ (p. 324)

```
Setting a warning distance for City
Safety
City Safety is always active, but the function's
warning distance can be adjusted.
```
```
NOTE
The City Safety function cannot be deacti-
vated. It is activated automatically each time
the engine/electric motor is started.
```
```
The alert distance determines the sensitivity of
the system and regulates the distance at which
the light, sound and brake pulsations will be acti-
vated.
To select warning distance:
```
1. Select Settings My Car IntelliSafe in
    the center display's Top view.
2. Under City Safety Warning, tap Late,
    Normal or Early to set the desired warning
    distance.
If the driver feels that the Early setting is giving
too many warnings or finds them irritating, the
Normal or Late warning distance settings can
be selected instead.
If the driver feels that the warnings are too fre-
quent and distracting, the warning distance can
be reduced. This will reduce the total number of
warnings, but it will also result in City Safety pro-
viding warnings at a later stage.


## ||

## DRIVER SUPPORT

328

```
The Late warning distance setting should there-
fore only be used in exceptional cases, such as
when a more dynamic driving style is preferred.
```
```
WARNING
```
- No automatic system can guarantee
    100% correct function in all situations.
    You should therefore never test use of
    City Safety in the direction of people, ani-
    mals or vehicles – this could lead to
    severe damage, serious personal injury or
    even death.
- City Safety warns the driver if there is a
    risk of collision, but the function cannot
    reduce the driver's reaction time.
- Even if the warning distance has been set
    to Early, warnings may be perceived as
    late in certain situations – e.g. when there
    are large speed differences or if the vehi-
    cle ahead suddenly brakes heavily.
- With the warning distance set to Early,
    warnings come further in advance. This
    may cause the warnings to come more
    frequently than with warning distance
    Normal, but is recommended since it can
    make City Safety more effective.

```
NOTE
The warning with direction indicators for Rear
Collision Warning is deactivated if the colli-
sion warning distance in the City Safety func-
tion is set to the lowest level "Late".
The seat belt tensioning and braking func-
tions remain active.

```
Vehicles
City Safety detects most types of vehicles that
are either stationary, moving in the same direc-
tion as your vehicle or those described in "City
Safety in crossing traffic".
For City Safety to be able to detect a vehicle in
the dark, its headlights and taillights must be on
and clearly visible.
```
```
Cyclists
```
```
Optimal examples of what City Safety would interpret to
be a cyclist: clear body and bicycle shapes.

```
and lower body in combination with normal
human movements.

If large portions of the cyclist's body or the bicy-
cle itself are not visible to the function's camera,
it will not be able to detect a cyclist.

The system can only detect adult cyclists riding
on bicycles intended for adults.

```
WARNING
City Safety is supplementary driver support,
but it cannot detect all cyclists in all situations
and, for example, cannot see:
```
- partially obscured cyclists.
- cyclists if the background contrast of the
    cyclist is poor - warning and brake inter-
    ventions may then be late or not occur at
    all.
- cyclists in clothing that hides their body
    contour.
- bikes loaded with large objects.
The driver is always responsible for ensuring
that the vehicle is driven correctly and with a
safety distance suitable for the speed.

```
Pedestrians
```
```
Optimal examples of what the system considers to be a
pedestrian: clear body contours.
For optimal performance, the system's function
for pedestrian detection needs the clearest pos-
sible information about body and bicycle con-
tours. This entails being able to detect the con-
tours of the pedestrian's head, arm, shoulders,
legs, torso and lower body in combination with
normal human movements.
In order to detect a pedestrian, there must be a
contrast to the background, which could depend
on clothing, weather conditions, etc. If there is lit-
tle contrast, the person may be detected late or
not at all, which may result in a delayed reaction
from the system or no reaction at all.
City Safety can detect pedestrians even in dark
conditions if they are illuminated by the vehicle's
headlights.
```
```
WARNING
City Safety is supplementary driver support,
but it cannot detect all pedestrians in all sit-
uations and, for example, cannot see:
```
- partially obscured pedestrians, people in
    clothing that hides their body contour or
    pedestrians shorter than 80 cm (32 in.).
- pedestrians if the background contrast of
    the pedestrians is poor - warning and
    brake interventions may then be late or
    not occur at all.
- pedestrians who are carrying large
    objects.
The driver is always responsible for ensuring
that the vehicle is driven correctly and with a
safety distance suitable for the speed.

Large animals
```
```
Optimal examples of what City Safety would interpret as
a large animal: stationary or moving slowly and with clear
body contours.
For optimal performance, the system's function
for detecting large animals (e.g. moose, horses,
etc.) needs the clearest possible information
about body contours. This entails being able to
detect the animal straight from the side in combi-
nation with normal movements for that animal.
If parts of the animal's body are not visible to the
function's camera, the system will not be able to
detect the animal.
City Safety can detect large animals even in dark
conditions if they are illuminated by the vehicle's
headlights.
```
```
WARNING
City Safety is supplementary driver support,
but it cannot detect all large animals in all sit-
uations and, for example, cannot see:
```
- partially obscured larger animals.
- larger animals seen from the front or from
    behind.
- running or fast moving larger animals.
- larger animals if the contrast of the ani-
    mal's background is poor - warning and
    brake interventions may then occur late
    or not at all.
- smaller animals such as cats and dogs.
The driver is always responsible for ensuring
that the vehicle is driven correctly and with a
safety distance suitable for the speed.

Limitations of City Safety in
crossing traffic
In certain situations, it may be difficult for City
Safety to help the driver avoid a collision with
crossing traffic.
```
```
For example:
```
- on slippery roads when Electronic Stability
    Control (ESC) is actively operating
- if an approaching vehicle is detected at a late
    stage
- if the oncoming vehicle is partially obstructed
    by another vehicle or object
- if the oncoming vehicle's headlights are off
- if the oncoming vehicle is moving erratically
    and e.g. suddenly changes lanes at a late
    stage.

City Safety and delayed evasive
maneuvers
City Safety can assist the driver by automatically
braking the vehicle when it is not possible to
avoid a collision by steering alone.
```
```
City Safety assists the driver by periodically
attempting to predict possible "escape routes" to
the sides of the vehicle in the event a slow-mov-
ing or stationary vehicle were to be detected at a
late stage.
```
```
Your vehicle (1) cannot detect any potential escape
routes for veering away from the vehicle ahead (2) and
may therefore apply the brakes at an earlier stage.
Own vehicle
```
```
Slow-moving/stationary vehicles
```
```
City Safety will not intervene to automatically
apply the brakes if it is possible for the driver to
avoid a collision by steering the vehicle.
```
```
However, if City Safety determines that an eva-
sive maneuver would not be possible due to traf-
fic in the adjacent lane(s), the function can assist
the driver by automatically starting to apply the
brakes at an earlier stage.
```
```
WARNING
```
- The possibility of City Safety predicting a
    certain situation is supplementary driver
    support intended to improve driving safety
    - it cannot handle all situations in all traf-
    fic, weather and road conditions.
- City Safety is not a substitute for the driv-

City Safety limitations
City Safety functionality may be reduced in cer-
tain situations.

Surroundings

Low objects
Hanging objects, such as flags for overhanging
loads or accessories such as auxiliary lights or
front protective grids that extend beyond the
height of the hood, may limit City Safety function-
ality.

Slippery road conditions
The extended braking distance on slippery roads
may reduce City Safety's capacity to help avoid a
collision. In these types of situations, the Anti-
lock Braking System and Electronic Stability Con-
trol (ESC^73 ) will help provide optimal braking
power with maintained stability.

Backlighting
The visual warning signal in the windshield may
be difficult to detect in bright sunlight, if there are
reflections, or if the driver is wearing sunglasses
or not looking straight ahead.

Heat
If the temperature in the passenger compartment
is high due to e.g. bright sunlight, the visual warn-
ing signal in the windshield may be temporarily
disabled.

```
Camera and radar sensor's field of vision
The camera's field of vision is limited and in cer-
tain situations, it may be unable to detect pedes-
trians, large animals, cyclists or vehicles, or it may
detect them later than expected.
Vehicles that are dirty may be detected later than
clean vehicles, and in dark conditions, motorcy-
cles may be detected late or not at all.
If a text message displayed in the instrument
panel indicates that the camera/radar sensor is
obstructed, it may be difficult for City Safety to
detect pedestrians, large animals, cyclists, vehi-
cles or lane markings in front of the vehicle. City
Safety functionality may therefore be reduced.
Text messages may not be displayed for all situa-
tions in which the windshield sensors are
blocked. The driver must therefore always keep
the windshield in front of the camera/radar sen-
sor clean.
```
```
CAUTION
Maintenance and replacement of City Safety
components may only be performed by a
workshop – an authorized Volvo workshop is
recommended.
```
```
Driver intervention
Backing up
City Safety is temporarily deactivated when the
vehicle is backing up.
Low speed
City Safety is not activated at very low speeds
under 4 km/h (3 mph). The system will therefore
not intervene in situations in which your vehicle is
approaching another vehicle very slowly, such as
when parking.
Active driver
Action by the driver always has priority. City
Safety will therefore not react or will react at a
later stage with a warning or intervention in situa-
tions in which the driver is clearly steering and
operating the accelerator pedal, even if a collision
is unavoidable.
An active and aware driving style may therefore
delay collision warnings and intervention in order
to minimize unnecessary warnings.

WARNING
```
- Warnings and brake interventions can be
    triggered late or not at all if the traffic sit-
    uation or external influences prevent the
    camera and radar unit from properly
    detecting pedestrians, cyclists, large ani-
    mals or vehicles ahead of the vehicle.
- To be able to detect vehicles at night, its
    front and rear lights must work and illumi-
    nate clearly.
- The camera and radar unit have a limited
    range for pedestrians and cyclists – the
    system can provide effective warnings
    and brake interventions if the relative
    speed is lower than 50 km/h (30 mph).
    For stationary or slow-moving vehicles,
    warnings and brake interventions are
    effective at vehicle speeds of up to
    70 km/h (43 mph). Speed reduction for
    large animals is less than 15 km/h
    (9 mph) and can be achieved at vehicle
    speeds over 70 km/h (43 mph). At lower
    speeds, the warning and brake interven-
    tion for large animals is less effective.
- Warnings for stationary or slow-moving
    vehicles and large animals can be disen-
    gaged due to darkness or poor visibility.
       - Warnings and brake interventions for
          pedestrians and cyclists are disengaged
          at vehicle speeds over 80 km/h
          (50 mph).
       - Do not place, affix or mount anything on
          the inside or outside of the windshield, or
          in front of or around the camera and
          radar unit – this could disrupt camera-
          based functions.
       - Objects, snow, ice or dirt in the area of
          the camera sensor can reduce the func-
          tion, disengage it completely or give an
          improper function response.

Rear Collision Warning
The Rear Collision Warning (RCW) function can
help the driver avoid rear-end collisions from
vehicles approaching from behind.
```
```
RCW is automatically activated each time the
engine is started.
RCW can warn the driver of a potential collision
with vehicles approaching from behind by rapidly
flashing the turn signals.
If, at a speed below 30 km/h (20 mph), the RCW
function detects that the car is in danger of being
hit from behind, the seatbelt tensioners may ten-
sion the front seatbelts and activate the Whiplash
Protection System safety system.
Immediately before a collision from behind, RCW
may also activate the foot brake in order to
reduce the forward acceleration of the car during
the collision. However, the brakes will only be
applied if your vehicle is stationary. The brakes
will be immediately released if the accelerator
pedal is depressed.

Rear Collision Warning limitations
In some situations, it may be difficult for RCW to
warn the driver of a collision risk.
This may be the case if:
```
- the vehicle approaching from the rear is
    detected at a late stage
- the vehicle approaching from the rear
    changes lanes at a late stage
- the vehicle approaching from the rear is mov-
    ing at a speed above 80 km/h (50 mph)
- a trailer, bicycle holder or similar is con-
    nected to the vehicle's electrical system - the
    RCW function will then be automatically
    deactivated.

```
NOTE
In certain markets RCW does not warn with
the direction indicators due to local traffic
regulations – in such cases, that part of the
function is deactivated.
```
```
NOTE
The warning with direction indicators for Rear
Collision Warning is deactivated if the colli-
sion warning distance in the City Safety func-
tion is set to the lowest level "Late".
The seat belt tensioning and braking func-
tions remain active.

BLIS *****

The BLIS^74 function is designed to help provide
assistance in heavy traffic with several lanes
moving in the same direction by helping the
driver to detect the presence of vehicles in the
"blind spot" area behind and to the side of the
vehicle.

BLIS is a driver support system designed to alert
the driver of:

- vehicles in your "blind spot"
- vehicles approaching rapidly in adjacent
    lanes.

Cross Traffic Alert *
CTA^82 is a supplementary driver support system
to BLIS^83 that is intended to help the driver
detect vehicles crossing behind the vehicle
while backing up.
```
```
CTA overview.
CTA supplements BLIS by detecting traffic cross-
ing from the side, e.g. when backing out of a
parking space.
CTA is primarily designed to detect vehicles, but
in certain cases can also detect pedestrians or
smaller objects such as bicycles.
CTA is only active when the vehicle is moving
backward or if reverse gear is engaged.
```
```
If CTA detects that something is approaching
your vehicle from the side:
```
- an audible signal will sound from either the
    left or right speaker, depending on which
    side of your vehicle the object is approaching
    from.
- an icon will illuminate in the PAS

Cross Traffic Alert limitations
CTA^87 functionality may be reduced in certain
situations.
```
```
CTA does not function optimally in all situations
and has certain limitations. The CTA sensors, for
example, cannot "see" through other parked
vehicles or objects blocking the vehicle.
Below are a few examples of situations in which
CTA's field of vision may be initially limited and
approaching vehicles may therefore not be
detected until they are very close to your vehicle:
```
```
The vehicle is parked very far into a parking space.
```
```
In a diagonal parking space, CTA may be completely
"blind" on one side of your vehicle.

```
```

```
```
However, as you back your vehicle slowly out of a
parking space, CTA's field of vision changes in
relation to the obstructing vehicle/object and its
blind zone is reduced.

Driver Alert Control limitations
Driver Alert Control (DAC) functionality may be
reduced in certain situations.
```
```
In certain situations, the system may provide a
warning even if it has not detected a change in
driving behavior, e.g.:
```
- in strong crosswinds
- on grooved road surfaces.

```
WARNING
In certain cases, driving behavior might not be
affected despite the driver's fatigue – when
using the Pilot Assist function – resulting in
the driver not getting a warning from DAC.
It is therefore very important to always stop
and take a break at the slightest sign of fati-
gue, regardless of whether the DAC function
has issued a warning or not.
```
```
NOTE
The function uses the vehicle's camera unit,
which has some general limitations – see the
section "Camera unit limitations".

Lane Keeping Aid
Lane Keeping Aid (LKA^103 ) is designed to
actively steer the vehicle on freeways, highways
and other major roads to help the driver reduce
the risk of the vehicle unintentionally veering out
of the lane.
```
```
Lake Keeping Assistance steers the vehicle back
into the lane and/or alerts the driver using vibra-
tions in the steering wheel.
Lane Keeping Aid is active at speeds between
65-200 km/h (40-125 mph) on roads with
clearly visible traffic lane marker lines.
On narrow roads, the function may be unavailable
and go into standby mode. The function will
become available again when the road becomes
sufficiently wide.
```

    improve driving safety – it cannot handle
    all situations in all traffic, weather and
    road conditions.
- The function is not a substitute for the

Steering assistance at risk of
collision

The Collision avoidance assistance function
is intended to help the driver reduce the risk of
the vehicle inadvertently veering from the traffic
lane and/or colliding with another vehicle or
obstacle by actively steering the vehicle back
into the lane and/or swerving out of the way.

Collision avoidance assistance consists of
three sub-functions:

- Run-Off Mitigation with steering assistance
- Steering assistance during collision risks
    from oncoming traffic
- Steering assistance during collision risks
    from behind*

After the system has automatically intervened,
this text message will appear in the instrument
panel:

- Collision avoidance assistance –
    Automatic intervention

```
NOTE
It is always the driver who must decide how
much the vehicle should be in control – the
vehicle can never take command.

Run-Off Mitigation with steering
assistance
This sub-function is intended to help reduce the
risk of the vehicle inadvertently running off the
road by actively steering the vehicle back onto
the road.
```
```
The function is active at speeds between
65-140 km/h (40-87 mph) on roads with clearly
visible traffic lane markings/lines.
The system uses a camera to monitor the edges
of the road and the painted side marker lines. If
the vehicle is about to cross the edge of the road,
the function will attempt to steer the vehicle back
onto the road. If this is not sufficient to keep the
vehicle on the road, the brakes will also be
applied.
However, the function will not provide either
steering assistance or braking if the turn signal is
used. The function will also not be activated if it
detects that the driver is actively operating the
vehicle.
After the system has automatically intervened,
this text message will appear in the instrument
panel:
```
- Collision avoidance assistance –

```
WARNING
```
- The "Steering assistance at risk of run-
    off" subfunction is supplementary driver
    support intended to help improve driving

Park Assist front, rear and sides
Park Assist has different parameters depending
on which part of the vehicle is approaching an
obstacle.

Back

Note: This illustration is general and details may vary
depending on model.

The rear sensors will be activated if the vehicle
begins rolling backward or if reverse gear is
engaged.

The distance monitored begins
approx. 1.5 meters (5 feet) behind the vehicle.

The rear sensors will be automatically deactivated
if the vehicle is backing up with a trailer attached.

```
NOTE
When reversing with e.g. a trailer or bike car-
rier on the trailer hitch – without Volvo original
trailer cables – the Parking Assist system may
have to be turned off manually to prevent the
sensors from reacting to these.
```
```
Side sensors
```
```
Park Assist's side sensors are automatically acti-
vated when the engine is started. They are active
at speeds below 10 km/h (6 mph).
The distance monitored begins approx. 30 cm
(1 ft) from the sides. The audible signal for obsta-
cles along the sides of the vehicle is emitted
from the side speakers.
```
```
Front camera
```
```
Note: This illustration is general and details may vary
depending on model.
Park Assist's front sensors are automatically acti-
vated when the engine is started. The front sen-
sors are active at speeds below 10 km/h
(6 mph).
The distance monitored begins approx. 80 cm
(2.5 ft) in front of the vehicle.
```

The driver should be aware of the following limi-
tations for Park Assist:
```
```
WARNING
Be extra cautious when
reversing if this symbol is
shown when a trailer, bike
carrier or similar is attached
and electrically connected
to the vehicle.
The symbol indicates that
the rear parking assist sensors are deacti-
vated and will not warn of any obstacles.
```

## DRIVER SUPPORT

```
* Option/accessory. 373
```
```
CAUTION
Objects such as chains, thin and glossy poles
or low obstacles may end up in the "signal
shadow" and then go temporarily undetected
by the sensors – the pulsating tone may then
unexpectedly stop instead of becoming a
constant tone as expected.
The sensors cannot detect high objects, such
as protruding ramps.
```
- In such situations, pay extra attention and
    maneuver/drive the vehicle very slowly or
    stop the current parking maneuver –
    there may be a high risk of damage to
    the vehicle or other objects since infor-
    mation from the sensors is not always
    reliable in such situations.

```
CAUTION
In some circumstances, the Park Assist Sys-
tem may produce false warnings due to exter-
nal sound sources with the same ultrasonic
frequencies as those the system works with.
Examples of such sources are horns, wet tires
on asphalt, pneumatic brakes, exhaust noise
from motorcycles, etc.
```

NOTE
When a trailer hitch is configured with the
vehicle electrical system, the trailer hitch pro-
trusion is included when the function meas-
ures the distance to objects behind the vehi-
cle.

Park Assist Camera trajectory lines
The Park Assist Camera uses trajectory lines
and fields on the screen to indicate the vehicle's
position in relation to its immediate surround-
ings.
```
```
Example^117 of trajectory lines.
The trajectory lines show the anticipated trajec-
tory for the vehicle's outermost dimensions based
on the current position of the steering wheel to
```
```
help simplify parallel parking, backing into tight
spaces or attaching a trailer.
The lines on the screen are projected as if they
were painted lines on the ground behind the
vehicle and are directly affected by the way in
which the steering wheel is turned. This enables
the driver to see path the vehicle will take, even if
he/she turns the steering wheel.
These lines also indicate the outermost limits that
any object (towbar, rearview mirrors, corners of
the body, etc.) extends out from the vehicle.
```
```
NOTE
```
- When reversing with a trailer that is not
    electrically connected to the vehicle, the
    screen guide lines show the path the
    vehicle will take – not the trailer.
- The screen does not show guide lines
    when a trailer is electrically connected to
    the vehicle's electrical system.
- Guide lines are not shown when zooming
    in.

Leaving a parking space with Park
Assist Pilot
The function Park Out can also help the driver
to leave a parking space.
NOTE
Leaving a parking space with the Park Out
function should only be used in connection
with parallel parking – it does not work for
perpendicular parking.
```
```
The Park Out function is acti-
vated in the center display's
Function view or in Camera
view.
```
```
To do so:
```
1. Tap Park Out in Function view or in Camera
    view.
2. Move the gear selector to the suitable posi-
    tion (e.g. D or R) for the direction in which
    you will be pulling out of the parking space.
3. Be prepared to stop the vehicle when
    instructed to do so by a graphic and mes-
    sage in the center display. Follow the instruc-
    tions in the same way as for the parking pro-
    cedure.
Note that the steering wheel can "spring" back
when the procedure is completed and the driver

```
may need to turn the steering wheel back to the
maximum position in order to pull out of the park-
ing space.
If PAP determines that the driver can pull out of
the parking space without any extra maneuvers,
the function will be deactivated, even if it seems
as though the vehicle is not completely out of the
parking space.

Park Assist Pilot ***** limitations

Park Assist Pilot PAP^123 may not be able to
detect all conditions in all situations and func-
tionality may therefore be limited.

```
WARNING
```
- The PAP function is supplementary driver
    support intended to facilitate driving and
    help make it safer – it cannot handle all
    situations in all traffic, weather and road
    conditions.
- Pay particular attention to people and
    animals near the vehicle.
- Bear in mind that the front end of the
    vehicle may swing out towards oncoming
    traffic during the parking maneuver.
- Objects situated higher than the detec-
    tion area of the sensors are not included
    when the parking maneuver is calculated,
    which could cause PAP to swing into the
    parking space too early. Such parking
    spaces should be avoided for this reason.
- PAP is not a substitute for the driver's
    attention and judgment. The driver is
    always responsible for ensuring the vehi-
    cle is driven in a safe manner, at the
    appropriate speed, with an appropriate
    distance to other vehicles, and in accord-
    ance with current traffic rules and regula-
    tions.

```
The driver should be aware of the following limi-
tations for Park Assist Pilot:
```
```
The parking sequence is cancelled
A parking sequence will be cancelled if:
```
- the driver moves the steering wheel
- the vehicle's speed exceeds 7 km/h (4 mph)
- the driver taps Cancel in the center display
- when the anti-lock brakes or the Electronic
    stability control are engaged - e.g. when a
    wheel loses grip on a slippery road
- when the power steering works at reduced
    power - e.g. during cooling due to overheat-
    ing (see section "Speed-dependent steering
    force").

```
A message in the center display will explain why
the parking sequence was cancelled.
```
```
CAUTION
Under certain circumstances, PAP may not be
able to find parking spaces – one reason may
be that the sensors are disrupted by external
sound sources that emit the same ultrasonic
frequencies that the system works with.
Examples of such sources include horns, wet
tires on asphalt, pneumatic brakes, exhaust
noise from motorcycles, etc.

NOTE
Dirt, ice and snow covering the sensors
reduce their function and can make measure-
ment impossible.
```
```
Driver responsibility
The driver should keep in mind that PAP is a
parking aid ‒ not an infallible fully automatic sys-
tem. The driver must always be prepared to take
control and cancel a parking sequence if neces-
sary.
There are a number of things to keep in mind
when parking, including:
```
- The driver is always responsible for determin-
    ing if the space suggested by PAP is suita-
    ble for parking.
- Do not use PAP when using snow chains or
    a temporary spare tire.
- Do not use PAP if there are any objects pro-
    truding from the vehicle.
- Heavy rain or snowfall may inhibit PAP's abil-
    ity to accurately measure a parking space.
- While searching and measuring the parking
    space, PAP may be unable to detect objects
    located far into the space.
- PAP may not suggest parking spaces on
    narrow streets if it does not detect sufficient
    space for maneuvering the vehicle.
       - Use approved tires^124 inflated to the correct
          tire pressure because this affects PAP's abil-
          ity to provide parking assistance.
       - PAP's function is based on the way the vehi-
          cles are parked behind and in front of your
          parking space. If they are, for example,
          parked too close to the curb, there is a risk
          that your vehicle's tires or wheel rims could
          be damaged by the curb during the parking
          procedure.
       - Perpendicular parking spaces may not be
          detected or may be suggested unnecessarily
          if a parked vehicle is sticking out more than
          other parked vehicles.
       - PAP is intended to provide parking assis-
          tance on straight streets, not sections of
          street with sharp curves or bends. Always
          make sure that your vehicle is parallel to rel-
          evant parking spaces when PAP is measur-
          ing the parking space.

```
CAUTION
Switching to another approved wheel and/or
tire dimension could change the tire circum-
ference, which would then require the PAP
system to be updated. Consult a workshop –
an authorized Volvo workshop is recom-
mended.

WARNING
Before starting:
```
- Buckle your seat belt.
- Adjust the seat, steering wheel and mir-
    rors.
- Make sure you can fully depress the
    brake pedal.

```
The remote key is not physically used to start the
ignition because the vehicle is equipped with the
keyless Passive Start system.
To start the vehicle:
```
1. The remote key must be inside the vehicle.
    For vehicles with Passive Start, the key must
    be in the front section of the passenger
    compartment. With the optional keyless lock-
    ing/unlocking function*, the key can be any-
    where in the vehicle.
2. Press and hold down the brake pedal^1 as far
    as possible.
3. Turn the start knob clockwise and release.
    The control will automatically return to the
    original position.

```
WARNING
```
- Never use more than one inlay mat at a
    time on the driver's floor. If any other type
    of floor mat is used, remove the original
    mat from the driver's seat floor before
    driving. All types of mats must be securely
    anchored in the attachment points in the
    floor. Make sure the floor mat does not
    impede the movement of the brake pedal
    or accelerator pedal in any way, as this
    could be a serious safety hazard.
- Volvo's floor mats are specially manufac-
    tured for your vehicle. They must be prop-
    erly secured in the attachment points in
    the floor to help ensure they cannot slide
    and become trapped under the pedals.

```
The starter motor will crank until the engine
starts or until its overheating protection is trig-
gered.
```
(^1) If the vehicle is moving, it is only necessary to turn the start knob clockwise to start the engine.

If the Vehicle key not found message is shown
in the instrument panel at start, place the remote
key at the backup reader and then make a new
start attempt.

```
NOTE
When the remote key is placed in the backup
reader, make sure that no other vehicle keys,
metal objects or electronic devices (e.g. cellu-
lar phones, tablets, laptops or chargers) are in
the backup reader. Multiple vehicle keys close
to each other in the backup reader can dis-
rupt their functionality.
```
```
CAUTION
If the engine has not responded after 3
attempts – wait for 3 minutes before starting
a new attempt. Starting capability increases if
the starter battery is given time to recover.
```
```
WARNING
Never remove the remote control key from
the vehicle while driving or the vehicle is
being towed.
```
```
WARNING
```
- Always remove the remote key from the
    passenger compartment when you leave
    the vehicle and make sure the ignition is
    in mode 0.
- Always put the gear selector in P and
    apply the parking brake before leaving
    the vehicle. Never leave the vehicle unsu-
    pervised while the engine is running.
- Always open the garage door fully and
    make sure that ventilation is very good
    before starting the engine in a garage.
    The exhaust fumes produced by the vehi-
    cle contain carbon monoxide, which is
    invisible and odorless but very toxic.

```
WARNING
Always take along the remote control key
when leaving the vehicle and make sure that
the vehicle electrical system is in ignition
mode 0 – especially if there are children in
the vehicle.
```
```
NOTE
With a cold start, idling speed may be consid-
erably higher than normal for certain engine
types. This is done to get the emissions sys-
tem up to normal operating temperature as
quickly as possible, which minimizes exhaust
emissions and protects the environment.
```
```
CAUTION
```
- When starting in cold weather, the auto-
    matic transmission may shift up at slightly
    higher engine speeds than normal until
    the automatic transmission fluid reaches
    normal operating temperature.
- Do not race a cold engine immediately
    after starting. This could prevent fluids
    from properly lubricating vital compo-
    nents in the engine before it has reached
    the proper operating temperature.
- The engine should be idling when the
    gear selector is moved. Never accelerate
    until the gear is fully engaged. Accelerat-
    ing rapidly before a gear is properly
    engaged could lead to harder wear of
    components.
- To help prevent the transmission oil from
    overheating, select P or N when idling at
    a standstill for prolonged periods of time.

Brake functions
The vehicle's brakes are used to reduce speed
or prevent the vehicle from rolling.
```
```
In addition to the wheel brakes and parking
brakes, the vehicle is also equipped with a num-
ber of automatic brake assist functions. These
systems help the driver by e.g. keeping the vehi-
cle stationary when the brake pedal is not
depressed (e.g. at a traffic light or intersection),
when starting up a hill or when driving down a hill.
Depending on how the vehicle is equipped, the
following brake assist functions may be included:
```
- Auto-hold brakes (Auto Hold)
- Hill Start Assist (Hill Start Assist)
- Braking assist after a collision
- City Safety

```
Brakes
The brake pedal is used to apply the vehicle's
regular brakes, which are part of the brake sys-
tem.
The vehicle is equipped with two brake circuits. If
one brake circuit is damaged, the brake pedal will
go down further when depressed. More pressure
will then be required from the driver for normal
braking effect.

The driver's pressure on the brake pedal is
enhanced by a power braking function.

```
WARNING
Power braking only functions if the engine is
running.
```
If the brake pedal is used when the engine is
turned off, the pedal will feel stiffer than usual
and greater pressure must be applied to brake
the vehicle.

In very hilly areas or when driving with a heavy
load, manual gear shifting can be used to aug-
ment the brakes with engine braking. Engine
braking is most effective if the same gear is used
both uphill and downhill.

Anti-lock brakes
The vehicle is equipped with an Anti-lock Braking
System (ABS), which can help prevent the
wheels from locking and help maintain steering
control when braking. Vibrations may be felt from

```
the brake pedal when ABS is operating, which is
normal.
After the vehicle is started, a brief test of the
ABS system is automatically performed when the
driver releases the brake pedal. An additional
automatic test of the system may be performed
when the vehicle is traveling at a low speed. Dur-
ing the test, the brake pedal may feel as though it
is pulsating.

```
Brake Assist System
The brake enhancing system, Brake Assist
System (BAS), helps increase braking force and
thereby reduce braking distance.
The system monitors the driver's braking habits
and increases braking force when necessary.
Braking force can be increased up to the point at
which the ABS intervenes. The function is deacti-
vated when pressure on the brake pedal is
decreased.
```
```
NOTE
When BAS is activated, the brake pedal will
go down slightly more than usual. Press
(hold) down the brake pedal as long as nec-
essary.
When the brake pedal is released, all braking
ceases.
```
```
Related information
```
- Brakes (p. 399)

```
Braking on wet roads
Prolonged driving in heavy rain without braking
may cause braking effect to be slightly delayed
the first time the brakes are applied.
```
```
This may also occur after washing the vehicle. It
will then be necessary to apply greater pressure
to the brake pedal. You should therefore maintain
a greater distance to the vehicle ahead.
Firmly apply the brakes after washing the vehicle
or driving on wet roads. This helps warm up the
brake discs, enabling them to dry more quickly
and protecting them against corrosion. Consider
the current traffic situation when braking.

```
Braking on salted roads
When driving on salted roads, a layer of salt may
form on the brake discs and brake pads.

This could increase stopping distance. Maintain
an extra large safety distance to the vehicle
ahead. Make sure to also:

- Apply the brakes from time to time to help
    remove salt. Make sure braking does not
    pose a risk to any other road users.
- Gently apply the brakes when you have fin-
    ished driving and before driving again.

Maintenance of the brake system
Regularly check the brake system components
for wear.
To keep the vehicle as safe and reliable as possi-
ble, follow the Volvo service schedule specified in
the Warranty and Maintenance Records Informa-
tion booklet. New and replaced brake pads and
brake discs do not provide optimal braking effect
until they are "broken in" by driving a few hun-
dred kilometers (miles). Compensate for the
reduced braking effect by applying greater pres-
sure to the brake pedal. Volvo recommends only
using brake pads approved for your Volvo.
```
```
CAUTION
The brake system's components should be
regularly checked for wear.
Contact a workshop for advice on how to do
this or let a workshop perform the inspection
```
- an authorized Volvo workshop is recom-
mended.

- Brakes (p. 399)

```
Parking brake
The parking brake helps keep the vehicle sta-
tionary by mechanically locking two wheels.
```
```
The parking brake controls are located in the tunnel
console between the seats.
When the electric parking brake is being applied,
a faint sound can be heard from the brake's elec-
tric motor. This sound can also be heard during
the automatic function check of the parking
brake.
If the vehicle is stationary when the parking brake
is applied, it will only be applied to the rear
wheels. If it is applied while the vehicle is moving,
the normal brakes will be used on all four wheels.
Braking will be transferred to only the rear
wheels when the vehicle is almost stopped.

Parking on a hill
Always use the parking brake when parking on a
hill.
WARNING
Always apply the parking brake when parking
on an incline. Selecting a gear or putting the
automatic transmission in P may not be suffi-
cient to keep the vehicle stationary in all sit-
uations.
```
```
If the vehicle is pointing uphill:
```
- Turn the front wheels so they are pointing
    away from the curb.
If the vehicle is pointing downhill:
- Turn the front wheels so they are pointing
    toward the curb.
Heavy load uphill
Heavy loads, such as a trailer, could cause the
vehicle to roll backward when the parking brake
is released automatically on steep uphill gradi-
ents. To help avoid this, pull the control upward
while you are driving away. Release the control
when the vehicle gains traction.

Auto-hold brakes
With the Auto-hold brake function, the driver can
release the brake pedal and the brakes will
remain applied, for example, when the vehicle
has stopped at a traffic light or intersection.
When the vehicle stops, the brakes are activated
automatically. The function can use either the
normal brakes or the parking brakes to keep the
vehicle stationary and works on flat surfaces or
hills. When driving off, the brakes will be automat-
ically released if the driver's seat belt is buckled.
```
```
NOTE
When braking to a stop on an uphill or down-
hill gradient, depress the brake pedal with
slightly more force than usual before releas-
ing to ensure that the vehicle cannot move at
all.
```
```
The parking brake is activated if:
```
- the vehicle is switched off
- the driver's door is opened
- the driver's seat belt is removed
- the vehicle has been stationary for a pro-
    longed period of time (5-10 minutes)

Braking assist after a collision
In a collision in which the activation level is
reached for the pyrotechnic seat belt tensioners
or airbags, or if a collision with a large animal is
detected, the vehicle's brakes will be automati-
cally activated. This function is intended to help
prevent or reduce the effects of any subsequent
collision.

After a serious collision, it may no longer be pos-
sible to control and steer the vehicle. In order to
avoid or mitigate a possible further collision with
a vehicle or an object in the vehicle's path, the
brake assist system is activated automatically to
help stop the vehicle safely.

The brake lights and hazard warning flashers are
activated during braking. When the vehicle has
stopped, the hazard warning flashers will con-
tinue to flash and the parking brake will be
applied.

If braking is not appropriate, e.g. if there is a risk
of being hit by passing traffic, the driver can over-
ride the system by depressing the accelerator
pedal.

This function assumes that the brake system is
intact after a collision.

Brake assist is part of the Rear Collision Warning
and Blind Spot Information safety systems.

Transmission
The transmission is part of the vehicle's driveline
(power transmission) between the engine and
the drive wheels. The function of the transmis-
sion is to change gears depending on speed
and power needs.
The vehicle has an 8-speed automatic transmis-
sion. The number of gears allows the engine's
torque and power band to be effectively utilized.
Two of the gears are overdrive gears that save
fuel when driving at a constant engine speed.
Manual shifting is also possible. The instrument
panel shows the gear currently in use.
```
```
CAUTION
Check the operating temperature of the
transmission to help avoid damage to any of
the drive system components. If there is a risk
of overheating, a warning symbol will appear
in the instrument panel and a text message
will be displayed. Follow the recommenda-
tions given.

Shiftlock
The automatic transmission's shiftlock function
helps prevent inadvertently moving the gear
selector between different positions.

There are two types of shiftlocks: mechanical and
automatic.

Mechanical shiftlock

The gear selector can be moved back and forth
between N and D. The other positions have a
shiftlock that is operated using the lock button on
the gear selector.

Press and hold the shiftlock button and move the
gear selector forward or backward between P, R,
N and D.

Automatic shiftlock
The automatic shiftlock has a separate safety
system.

```
From Park - P
To move the gear selector from the P position,
the brake pedal must be depressed and the igni-
tion in mode II.
From Neutral - N
If the gear selector is in N and the vehicle has
been stationary for at least 3 seconds (with or
without the engine running), the gear selector will
be locked in that position.
To move the gear selector from N to another
gear, the brake pedal must be depressed and the
ignition in mode II.

The kickdown function
Kickdown is used when maximum acceleration is
needed, e.g. when passing.
When the accelerator pedal is depressed all the
way to the floor (past the normal full accelerator
position), the transmission will automatically
engage kickdown, i.e. immediately shift down to a
lower gear.
If the accelerator pedal is released from the kick-
down position, the transmission will automatically
shift up again.
Safety function
The transmission control module is equipped with
a downshift protection feature to help prevent the
engine from overheating.
In some conditions, the transmission will prevent
downshifting/kickdown if this would lead to such
high engine speed (rpm) that the engine could
be damaged. If the driver still attempts downshift-
ing or kickdown at a high rpm, nothing will hap-
pen and the original gear will remain selected.
With kickdown, the vehicle can downshift one or
more steps at a time depending on the engine
speed. The vehicle upshifts when the engine rea-
ches its maximum rpm to prevent engine dam-
age.

All Wheel Drive (AWD) *
All-wheel drive, All Wheel Drive (AWD), also
called four-wheel drive, means that power is dis-
tributed to all four wheels, which improves trac-
tion.
```
```
To achieve the best traction, power is automati-
cally directed to the wheels that have the best
grip. The system continuously calculates the
need for torque to the rear wheels, and can
immediately redistribute up to half of the engine's
torque to the rear wheels.
All-wheel drive also has a stabilizing effect at
higher speeds. In normal driving conditions, most
of the engine's power is directed to the front
wheels. When the vehicle is stationary, all-wheel
drive is always activated in preparation for maxi-
mum traction during acceleration.
All-wheel drive reacts differently depending on
which drive mode* is selected.

eco-friendly driving.
Use this mode to save fuel and promote eco-
friendly driving.
When ECO mode is activated, the following cha-
racteristics are modified:
```
- The automatic transmission's shifting points.
- Engine control and accelerator pedal
    response.
- Eco Coast functionality is activated and
    engine braking is disabled when the acceler-
    ator pedal is released at speeds between
    65 and 140 km/h (40 and 87 mph).
- Some of the climate system settings will be
    reduced or switched off.
- Information will be shown in the ECO gauge
    in the instrument panel to help promote
    more eco-friendly and economical driving.

```
Coast function Eco Coast
Eco Coast essentially deactivates engine braking,
allowing the vehicle's kinetic energy to be used
to roll greater distances. When the driver releases
the accelerator pedal, the transmission is auto-
matically disengaged from the engine. Engine
speed is reduced to idling speed to reduce fuel
consumption.
```

## ||

## STARTING AND DRIVING

416 * Option/accessory.

```
This function is most effective in driving situa-
tions where the vehicle can roll freely for a long
distance, e.g. on roads with slight downgrades or
when a decrease in speed is anticipated, such as
when approaching an area with a lower speed
limit.
Activating Eco Coast
The function is activated when the accelerator
pedal is fully released and the following condi-
tions are met:
```
- Eco drive mode is activated.
- The gear selector is in D.
- The vehicle's speed is approximately
    65-140 km/h (40-87 mph).
- The gradient of the downgrade is less than
    approximately 6%.
COASTING will be displayed in the instrument
panel when Eco Coast is being used.
Limitations
Eco Coast is not available if:
- The engine and/or transmission are not at
    normal working temperatures.
- The gear selector is moved from D to manual
    shifting mode.
- The vehicle's speed is not within the
    65-140 km/h (40-87 mph) range.
- The gradient of the downgrade is more than
    approximately 6%.
       - The steering wheel paddles* are being used
          for manual shifting.
       Deactivating and turning off Eco Coast
       In certain situations, it may be advisable to deac-
       tivate or turn off Eco Coast so that engine brak-
       ing can be used. These situations might include
       driving down steep hills or before passing
       another vehicle to help ensure this can be done
       as safely as possible.
       Deactivate Eco Coast by:
       - Pressing the accelerator or brake pedal.
       - Moving the gear selector to manual mode.
       - Using the steering wheel paddles* to shift.
       Turn off Eco Coast by:
       - Switching drive mode* or switching off drive
          mode Eco in Function view.
       It is possible to roll short distances even without
       Eco Coast in order to help conserve fuel. How-
       ever, for the best fuel economy, Eco Coast should
       be activated and used to roll longer distances.

```
Cruise control Eco Cruise
When cruise control is activated in the Eco drive
mode, the vehicle's acceleration and deceleration
will be slower than in other drive modes to help
further conserve fuel. Because of this, the vehi-
cle's actual speed may be slightly above or below
the set speed.
```
- On a level road, the vehicle's actual speed
    may differ from the set speed when cruise
    control is active and the vehicle is coasting.
- On a steep uphill gradient, the vehicle's
    speed is reduced until the transmission
    downshifts. Reduced acceleration is then ini-
    tiated in order to reach the set speed.
- On a downhill gradient in which the vehicle is
    coasting, the vehicle's actual speed may be
    slightly above or below the set speed. The
    function uses engine braking to keep the set
    speed. If necessary, the normal brakes are
    also applied.

```
ECO gauge in the instrument panel
The ECO gauge indicates how economical cur-
rent driving is:
```
- A low reading in the green area of the gauge
    indicates economical driving.
- A high reading is shown when driving is not
    economical, e.g. heavy braking or rapid accel-
    eration.
The ECO gauge also has an indicator showing
how a reference driver would drive in the same
driving situation. This is shown by the short
pointer in the gauge.

Start/Stop function
Start/Stop is a function that temporarily switches
off the engine when the vehicle has stopped,
e.g. at a traffic light or in heavy traffic, and then
starts it again automatically when the brake
pedal is released.
```
```
The Start/Stop function reduces fuel consump-
tion, which helps to reduce exhaust emissions.
The system makes it possible to drive more eco-
nomically and climate-smart by letting the engine
auto-stop when appropriate.

Driving with the Start/Stop function
Start/Stop is a function that temporarily turns off
the engine when the vehicle is stationary and
then automatically starts it again when the vehi-
cle starts moving.
The Start/Stop function is available when the
engine is started and can be activated if certain
conditions are met. The instrument panel indi-
cates if the function is available, active or not
available.
All of the vehicle's ordinary systems, such as
lighting, radio, etc. function normally when the
engine has been auto-stopped. Certain functions
may be temporarily reduced, however, such as
the climate system's blower speed or extremely
high audio system volume.
```
```
Auto-stop
To auto-stop the engine:
```
- Stop the vehicle by applying the brakes and
    keep the brake pedal depressed. The engine
    will auto-stop.
In Eco or Comfort^5 drive mode, the engine may
auto-stop before the vehicle has completely stop-
ped.
With Adaptive Cruise Control or Pilot Assist acti-
vated, the engine will auto-stop after approxi-
mately three seconds.

```
Auto-start
The following conditions must be met for the
engine to auto-start.
```
- Release the brake pedal. The engine will
    auto-start and the vehicle can be driven. On
    an uphill gradient, Hill Start Assist (HSA) will
    activate to help prevent the vehicle from roll-
    ing backward.
- When Auto-hold is activated, auto-start will
    be delayed until the accelerator is pressed.
- When Adaptive Cruise Control or Pilot Assist
    are activated, the engine will auto-start when
    the accelerator pedal is depressed or the
       button on the left-side steering wheel
    keypad is pressed.
- Maintain pressure on the brake pedal and
    press the accelerator pedal. The engine will
    auto-start.
- On a downhill gradient: Release the brake
    pedal slightly so that the vehicle begins to
    roll. The engine will auto-start after a slight
    increase in speed.

Economical driving
Drive economically and environmentally con-
scious by thinking ahead, avoiding rapid starts
and stops and adapting driving style and speed
to the current traffic conditions.
```
```
Driving economically conserves natural
resources
Observe the following rules:
```
- Do not warm up the engine by idling. It is
    better to begin driving normally immediately
    after starting the engine. A cold engine uses
    more fuel than a warm engine and is subject
    to increased wear.
- Whenever possible, avoid using the vehicle to
    drive short distances. The engine does not
    have time to reach a normal operating tem-
    perature and this leads to increased fuel
    consumption.
- Maintain a steady speed and a generous fol-
    lowing distance to traffic ahead to minimize
    braking.
- For lower fuel consumption, activate Eco
    drive mode.
- Use the Eco Coast function in drive mode
    Eco - engine braking is deactivated, allowing
    the vehicle's kinetic energy to be used to roll
    greater distances.
- Use gear D as often as possible and avoid
    using the kick-down function.
       - Fuel consumption is increased at high
          speeds - air resistance increases with speed.
       - Remove unnecessary items from the vehicle
          - the heavier the load, the higher the fuel
          consumption.
       - Maintain the correct pressure in the tires and
          check pressure regularly.
       - The type of tires used could affect fuel con-
          sumption - consult a retailer for advice on
          suitable tires.
       - Do not use winter tires after the winter sea-
          son has ended.
       - Roof loads increase air resistance and
          increase fuel consumption. Remove roof
          boxes, ski racks, etc. that are not in use.
       - Avoid driving with the windows open.
       - Using the trip computer's fuel consumption
          indicators can help you learn how to drive
          more economically.
       Other factors that decrease fuel
       consumption
       - Dirty air cleaner.
       - Dirty engine oil and clogged oil filter.
       - Incorrect front-end alignment.
       - Incorrect wheel alignment.
       Some of the above items and others are checked
       as part of Volvo's standard maintenance sched-
       ule.

Preparing for a long trip
It is important to have the vehicle's systems and
equipment checked carefully before driving long
distances.
Check that:
```
- the engine is running properly and that fuel
    consumption is normal
- there are no leaks (fuel, oil or other fluid)
- the brake pedal is functioning optimally
- all lights are working ‒ adjust the headlight
    height if the vehicle is carrying a heavy load
- tire tread depth and air pressure are at cor-
    rect levels. Change to snow tires when driv-
    ing in areas where there is a risk of snowy or
    icy roads.
- the start battery is sufficiently charged
- the wiper blades are in good condition

```
Winter driving
It is important to check the vehicle before driving
in cold/snowy conditions to make sure it can be
driven safely.
```
```
Before the cold season arrives:
```
- Make sure the engine coolant contains 50%
    antifreeze. This mixture helps protect the
    engine from frost erosion down to
    approx. -35 °C (-31 °F). Do not mix different
    types of antifreeze as this could pose a
    health risk.
- Keep the fuel tank well filled to prevent con-
    densation from forming.
- Check the viscosity of the engine oil. Oil with
    low viscosity (thinner oil) improves cold-
    weather starting and reduces fuel consump-
    tion when driving with a cold engine.

```
CAUTION
Low-viscosity oil should not be used with hard
driving or in hot weather.
```
- Check the condition and charge level of the
    start battery. Cold weather places greater
    demands on the start battery and reduces its
    capacity.
- Use washer fluid containing antifreeze to
    help prevent ice from forming in the washer
    fluid reservoir.

Driving through standing water
Driving the vehicle through a deep pool of stand-
ing water on a water-covered roadway is called
fording. This must be done with great caution.
The vehicle can be driven through water up to a
depth of 25 cm (9.8 in) at no more than walking
speed. Be particularly careful when driving
through flowing water.
When driving through standing water, drive slowly
and do not stop the vehicle. When you have
passed the water, press lightly on the brake pedal
and check that the brakes are functioning prop-
erly. Water, mud, slush, etc. can make the brake
linings slippery, resulting in delayed braking
effect.
```
- If the vehicle is equipped with contacts for an
    electric heater or trailer coupling, clean these
    after driving in water or mud.
- Do not allow the vehicle to stand in water up
    to the sills any longer than absolutely neces-
    sary. This could result in electrical malfunc-
    tions.

```
CAUTION
```
- Engine damage could occur if water
    enters the air cleaner.
- If water enters the transmission, the lubri-
    cating ability of the oils is reduced and
    the service life of these systems is short-
    ened.
- Damage to any component, engine,
    transmission, turbocharger, differential or
    its internal components caused by flood-
    ing, vapor lock or insufficient oil is not
    covered under warranty.
- If the engine stalls while the vehicle is in
    water, do not attempt to restart it. Have
    the vehicle towed out of the water to a
    workshop. An authorized Volvo workshop
    is recommended. Risk of engine failure.

Fuel
Volvo recommends the use of detergent gaso-
line to control engine deposits.
```
```
Deposit control gasoline (gasoline with
detergent additives)
Detergent gasoline is effective in keeping injec-
tors and intake valves clean. Consistent use of
deposit control gasolines will help ensure good
driveability and fuel economy. If you are not sure
whether the gasoline contains deposit control
additives, check with the service station operator.
```
```
NOTE
Volvo recommends not using external fuel
injector cleaning systems, e.g. do not add
detergent additives to gasoline before or after
refueling.
```
```
Unleaded fuel
All Volvo vehicles have a three-way catalytic con-
verter and must only use unleaded gasoline. US
and Canadian regulations require that pumps
delivering unleaded gasoline are labeled
"UNLEADED". Only the nozzles of these pumps
will fit in your vehicle's fuel filler inlet. It is unlaw-
ful to dispense leaded fuel into a vehicle labeled
"unleaded gasoline only". Leaded gasoline dam-
ages the three-way catalytic converter and the
heated oxygen sensor system. Repeated use of
leaded gasoline will lessen the effectiveness of
```
```
the emission control system and could result in
loss of emission warranty coverage. State and
local vehicle inspection programs will make
detection of misfueling easier, possibly resulting
in emission test failure for misfueled vehicles.
```
```
NOTE
Some U.S. and Canadian gasolines contain an
octane enhancing additive called methyl-
cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl
(MMT). If such fuels are used, your Emission
Control System performance may be affected,
and the Check Engine Light (malfunction
indicator light) located on your instrument
panel may light. If this occurs, please return
your vehicle to a trained and qualified Volvo
service technician for service.
```
```
Gasoline containing alcohol and ethers,
"Oxygenated fuels"
Some fuel suppliers sell gasoline containing
"oxygenates" which are usually alcohols or
ethers. In some areas, state or local laws require
that the service pump be marked indicating use
of alcohols or ethers. However, there are areas in
which the pumps are unmarked. If you are not
sure whether there is alcohol or ethers in the
gasoline you buy, check with the service station
operator. To meet seasonal air quality standards,
some areas require the use of "oxygenated" fuel.
```

## STARTING AND DRIVING



```
429
```
Volvo permits the use of the following "oxygen-
ated" fuels. However, the specified octane ratings
must still be met.

Alcohol - Ethanol
Fuels containing up to 10% ethanol by volume
may be used. Ethanol may also be referred to as
Ethyl alcohol, or "Gasohol".

Ethers - MTBE/ETBE: Fuels containing up to
15% MTBE/ETBE may be used.

Methanol
Do not use gasolines containing methanol
(methyl alcohol, wood alcohol). This practice can
result in vehicle performance deterioration and
can damage critical parts in the fuel system. Such
damage may not be covered under the New
Vehicle Limited Warranty.

Fuel Formulations
Do not use gasoline that contains lead or manga-
nese as a knock inhibitor, and do not use lead
additives. Besides damaging the exhaust emis-
sion control systems on your vehicle, lead has
been strongly linked to certain forms of cancer.
Many fuels contain benzene as a solvent.
Unburned benzene has been strongly linked to
certain forms of cancer. If you live in an area
where you must fill your own gas tank, take pre-
cautions. These may include:
```
- standing upwind away from the filler nozzle
    while refueling
- refueling only at gas stations with vapor
    recovery systems that fully seal the mouth of
    the filler neck during refueling
- wearing neoprene gloves while handling a
    fuel filler nozzle.

```
Use of Additives
With the exception of gas line antifreeze during
winter months, do not add solvents, thickeners, or
```
```
other store-bought additives to your vehicle's
fuel, cooling, or lubricating systems. Overuse may
damage your engine, and some of these additives
contain organically volatile chemicals. Do not
needlessly expose yourself to these chemicals.
```
```
WARNING
Never carry a cell phone that is switched on
while refueling your vehicle. If the phone rings,
this may cause a spark that could ignite gaso-
line fumes, resulting in fire and injury.
```
```
WARNING
Carbon monoxide is a poisonous, colorless,
and odorless gas. It is present in all exhaust
gases. If you ever smell exhaust fumes inside
the vehicle, make sure the passenger com-
partment is ventilated, and immediately return
the vehicle to a trained and qualified Volvo
service technician for correction.
```
```
Demanding driving
In demanding driving conditions, e.g. when driving
in a hot climates, driving with a trailer or driving
for longer periods at higher altitudes (mountain
landscapes) than normal, it is recommended
switching to a higher octane fuel than AKI 91^7 or
changing gasoline brand to take full advantage of
your car's engine capacity and obtain the opti-
mum driving force.

Emission controls

Three-way catalytic converter

- Keep your engine properly tuned. Certain
    engine malfunctions, particularly involving the
    electrical, fuel or distributor ignition systems,
    may cause unusually high three-way catalytic
    converter temperatures. Do not continue to
    operate your vehicle if you detect engine
    misfire, noticeable loss of power or other
    unusual operating conditions, such as engine
    overheating or backfiring. A properly tuned
    engine will help avoid malfunctions that
    could damage the three-way catalytic con-
    verter.
- Do not park your vehicle over combustible
    materials, such as grass or leaves, which can
    come into contact with the hot exhaust sys-
    tem and cause such materials to ignite under
    certain wind and weather conditions.
- Excessive starter cranking (in excess of one
    minute), or an intermittently firing or flooded
    engine can cause three-way catalytic con-
    verter or exhaust system overheating.
- Remember that tampering or unauthorized
    modifications to the engine, the Engine Con-
    trol Module, or the vehicle may be illegal and
    can cause three-way catalytic converter or
    exhaust system overheating. This includes:
    altering fuel injection settings or compo-
    nents, altering emission system components

```
or location or removing components, and/or
repeated use of leaded fuel.
```
```
NOTE
Unleaded fuel is required for vehicles with
three-way catalytic converters.
```
```
Heated oxygen sensors
The heated oxygen sensors monitor the oxygen
content of the exhaust gases. Readings are fed
into a control module that continuously monitors
engine functions and controls fuel injection. The
ratio of fuel to air into the engine is continuously
adjusted for efficient combustion to help reduce
harmful emissions.

Overheating of engine and
transmission
In demanding driving conditions, such as driving
in mountainous areas or hot weather, there is a
risk of the engine or transmission overheating,
especially when carrying heavy loads.
```
- Engine power may be temporarily limited.
- Remove any auxiliary lights mounted in front
    of the grille when driving in hot weather.
- If the temperature in the engine's cooling
    system becomes too high, a warning symbol
    will appear in the instrument panel along with
    the message Engine temperature High
    temperature Stop safely. Pull over to a
    safe location and let the engine idle for a few
    minutes to cool down.
- If the message Engine temperature^ High
    temperature Turn off engine or Engine
    coolant Level low, turn off engine is dis-
    played, stop the vehicle and turn off the
    engine.
- If the transmission begins to overheat, an
    alternative gear shifting program will be
    selected. An integrated protective function
    will also be activated, the warning symbol will
    illuminate and the message Transmission
    warm Reduce speed to lower

Battery drain
The electrical functions in the vehicle drain the
battery to varying degrees. Avoid using ignition
mode II when the engine is switched off. Use
ignition mode I instead, as this uses less electri-
cal current.
```
```
Note that certain accessories may also drain
power from the electrical system. Do not use
functions that use a lot of electrical current when
the engine is turned off. Examples of such func-
tions are:
```
- blower
- headlights
- windshield wipers
- audio system (especially at high volume).
If the starter battery voltage is low, a message is
shown in the driver display. The vehicle's energy-
saving function will then turn off or reduce certain
functions, such as the blower and/or the audio
system.
- Charge the battery by starting the engine
    and let it run for at least 15 minutes (driving
    charges the battery faster than letting the
    engine idle).

HD Radio™
HD Radio is a brand name registered by the DTS,
Inc.^3. They are the developer of a broadcasting
technology called IBOC or In Band On Channel,
which refers to the method of transmitting a digi-
tal radio broadcast signal centered on the same
frequency as the AM or FM station's present fre-
quency.
```
```
Introduction
```
```
Display when the radio is receiving an HD Radio broad-
cast (generic illustration)
```
```
NOTE
HD Radio volume may fade in and out at
times due to coverage limitations.
```
(^2) Certain stations only.
(^3) HD Radio™ technology is manufactured under license from DTS' U.S. and foreign Patents. HD Radio™ and the HD and HD Radio logos are proprietary trademarks of DTS.


## AUDIO, MEDIA AND INTERNET

```
453
```
The IBOC system is referred to as a "hybrid"
since it is both analog and digital. During hybrid
operation, receivers still continue to receive the
analog (non-digital) signal. HD Radio receivers
incorporate both modes of reception, where the
receiver will automatically switch to the analog
signal if the digital signal cannot be decoded or
is lost by the receiver.

When you have tuned to an HD Radio station, the

symbol will appear in the infotainment sys-
tem display. The symbol will be displayed in dif-
ferent colors:

- Grayed-out symbol: No HD Radio broad-
    cast reception
- White symbol: the radio is actively receiving
    an HD broadcast
- Orange symbol: the radio is receiving an
    HD broadcast with digital sound

More information about HD Radio and IBOC can
be found on DTS, Inc.'s website, [http://www.dts.com.](http://www.dts.com.)

Artist Experience™
A radio station's logo and album art can be dis-
played. If a station opts to provide this informa-
tion, it is broadcast once every 12 minutes, which
means that there may be a delay before the
logo/album art appear on the screen. The radio
can store 100 station logos so the next time the
radio is tuned to the same station, the logo will
be displayed immediately. Album art is synched
with the artist that you are currently listening to.

```
Ball game mode
This feature means that a main FM station (HD1)
will broadcast live events, where the content of
the programming is more important than sound
quality, in analog mode only to help prevent the
delay between analog and digital broadcasting.
The HD Radio symbol will be white during live
broadcasts and "Live" will be displayed next to
the symbol.
```
```
Benefits of digital broadcasting
```
- Better sound (FM sounds near CD quality
    and AM as analog FM).
- Some FM frequencies offer a greater num-
    ber of listening choices through "multicast-
    ing" (consisting of a frequency's main chan-
    nel and any sub-channels that may also be
    available on that particular frequency.)
- When receiving a digital signal there is no
    multipath disturbance or hisses/pops/crack-
    ling due to outside influences.

```
How HD Radio ™ Technology
broadcasting works
HD Radio works similarly to conventional radio
and broadcasts of this type are available in many
areas of the United States. However, there are a
few key differences:
```
- Instead of transmitting one analog signal,
    stations send out a bundled signal - both
    analog and digital.
- An HD Radio receiver can receive both digi-
    tal and analog broadcasts. Depending on the
    terrain and location of the vehicle (which will
    influence the signal strength), the receiver
    will determine which signal to receive.

Activating and deactivating the HD
Radio™
HD Radio is deactivated when the car leaves the
factory.
When listening to an HD Radio station and driv-
ing through areas with weak HD signals (fringe
areas), you may experience that the radio repeat-
edly switches between analog/digital and digital/
analog reception. If this happens, it may be desir-
able to switch HD off.
Carry out the following to activate or deactivate
HD Radio:
```
1. Drag down the top view and tap on
    Settings.
2. Press Media and AM/FM Radio.
3. Press HD Radio AM or HD Radio FM to
    activate/deactivate the function.
If HD radio is deactivated, the radio will be unable
to receive digital broadcasts but it will continue to
function as a conventional radio (analog AM/FM
receiver). Please note that when HD is switched
off, it will not be possible to tune in to sub-chan-
nels.
Note that if you activate or deactivate HD Radio
only the selected wavelength band is affected.

```
HD Radio™ sub-channels
In many cases, a main HD Radio station (FM
wavebands only) will also have sub-channels
offering additional types of programming or
music.
```
```
Sub-channels
```
```
Example of an HD Radio station with sub-channels
If any sub-channels are available, they will listed
below the main channel on the screen. In this
example, WILD-FM HD2 is a sub-channel.
```

```
Selecting sub-channels
To listen to a station's sub-channel(s), tap the
station on the screen or press the forward/back
arrow keys on the right-side steering wheel key-
pad or below the screen.

Sub-channels can also be saved as radio favor-
ites.

If you tap a sub-channel favorite, it may take up
to 6 seconds before the channel becomes audi-
ble. If you tap a station while you are out of digital
range of the transmitter, No reception will be
displayed.

HD Radio™ limitations

```
Limitations
```
- Main channel vs. sub-channels (FM only):
    The main channel is the only channel that
    can receive in hybrid mode (both digital and
    analog). If a frequency has sub-channels,
    they are broadcast in digital mode only. The
    main FM channel will be displayed as, for
    example, "WRIF-FM HD1". The sub-FM
    channels will be displayed as"WRIF-FM
    HD2", "WRIF-FM HD3", etc.
- Reception coverage area: Due to current
    IBOC transmitter power limitations, the
    reception coverage area in digital mode is
    somewhat more limited than the station's
    analog coverage area. Be aware that, like all
    radio transmission technology, terrain, time of
    day, vegetation and buildings can have a
    positive or negative effect on radio reception.
- Analog to digital/digital to analog blend-
    ing: Analog to digital blending will occur as
    the signal strength reaches a preset thresh-
    old in the receiver. This will be noticeable in
    fringe areas (areas with weak reception) and
    is normal.

```
NOTE
There may be a noticeable difference in
sound quality when a change from analogue
to digital or digital to analogue occurs, such
as:
```
- Volume increase or decrease
- Equalizer settings, i.e., Bass/ Midrange/
    Treble cut or boost
- Time alignment (Digital program material
    in extreme cases can be as much as 8
    seconds behind the analogue). This will
    noticeable as a "stuttering" effect.
The above items are dependant on the
broadcaster's equipment settings and do
not indicate a fault in the vehicle's radio
receiver or antenna systems.

```
Information about supported apps and compati-
ble phones is available on the Apple website:
[http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/.](http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/.) Using apps that are

make calls, send/receive text messages and
wirelessly play media from the vehicle, or con-
nect the vehicle to the Internet.

use as an Internet connection. To change what
the phone is used for when it is paired, go to
Bluetooth Devices settings.
After the device has been connected/registered
for the first time via Bluetooth, the device no
longer needs to be visible/searchable. It just
needs to have Bluetooth activated. To connect
the vehicle to the Internet using a phone, the

ing is between the phone and center display that
could be blocking the signal.
```
```
Phone to network operator
The speed of the mobile network varies depend-
ing on the coverage in the vehicle's current loca-
tion. Coverage may be poorer in e.g. tunnels,
mountainous areas, deep valleys or indoors. Con-
nection speed is also dependent on the subscrip-
tion you have with your service provider.

WHEELS AND TIRES


## WHEELS AND TIRES

508

```
Tires
The function of the tires is to carry loads, provide
traction on road surfaces, reduce vibrations and
protect the wheels from wear.
The tires significantly influence the vehicle's driv-
ing characteristics. The type, dimensions, tire
pressure and speed rating have a considerable
impact on how the vehicle performs.
Your vehicle is equipped with tires according to
the vehicle's tire information placard on the B-pil-
lar (the structural member at the side of the vehi-
cle, at the rear of the driver's door opening).
```
```
WARNING
A damaged tire could cause the driver to lose
control of the vehicle.
```
```
CAUTION
Some Volvo models are equipped with an
Ultra High Performance tire and wheel com-
bination designed to provide maximum dry
pavement performance with consideration for
hydroplaning resistance. They may be more
susceptible to road hazard damage and,
depending on driving conditions, may achieve
a tread life of less than 30,000 km (20,000
miles). Even if this vehicle is equipped with
Volvo's advanced AWD or stability system,
these tires are not designed for winter driving,
and should be replaced with winter tires when
weather conditions dictate.
```
```
The tires have good road holding characteristics
and offer good handling on dry and wet surfaces.
It should be noted however that the tires have
been developed to give these features on snow/
ice-free surfaces.
Most models are equipped with "all-season" tires,
which provide a somewhat higher degree of road-
holding on slippery road surfaces than tires with-
out the "all-season" rating. However, for optimal
roadholding on icy or snow-covered roads, we
recommend snow tires on all four wheels.
When replacing tires, be sure that the new tires
are the same size designation, type (radial) and
preferably from the same manufacturer, on all
```
```
four wheels. Otherwise there is a risk of altering
the vehicle's roadholding and handling characte-
ristics.
```
```
Recommended tires
On delivery, the car is equipped with Volvo origi-
nal tires that have the VOL^1 marking on the side
of the tires. These tires have been designed spe-
cifically for your vehicle. It is therefore important
when replacing tires that the new tires have this
same marking to help maintain the vehicle's driv-
ing characteristics, comfort and fuel consumption.
```
```
New tires
```
```
Tires are perishable goods. After a few years,
they will begin to harden and their friction proper-
ties will gradually deteriorate. Always replace tires
with the freshest tires possible. This is particularly
important for snow tires. A series of numbers is
```
(^1) This may vary for certain tire dimensions.

imprinted on the sidewall of the tire. The last four
digits in the series is the Department of
Transportation (DOT) stamp and indicates the
week and year the tire was manufactured. The
tire in the illustration has 0717 as the last four
digits, which means it was manufactured week 7
of 2017.

Tire age
Tires degrade over time, even when they are not
being used. It is recommended that tires gener-
ally be replaced after 6 years of normal service.
Heat caused by hot climates, frequent high load-
ing conditions or Ultra Violet (U.V.) exposure can
accelerate the aging process. The temporary
spare^2 should also be replaced at 6-year inter-
vals, even if it has never been used. A tire with
e.g., visible cracks or discoloration should be
replaced immediately.

Tire economy

- Maintain correct tire pressure.
- Avoid fast starts, hard braking and tire
    screeching.
- Tire wear increases with speed.
- Correct front wheel alignment is very impor-
    tant.
- Unbalanced wheels impair tire economy and
    driving comfort.
       - Tires must maintain the same direction of
          rotation throughout their lifetime.
       - When replacing tires, the tires with the most
          tread should be mounted on the rear wheels
          to reduce the chance of oversteer during
          hard braking.
       - Hitting curbs or potholes can damage the
          tires and/or wheels permanently.

```
Tire rotation
Your vehicle has no required tire rotation. Driving
style, tire pressure, climate and road conditions
affect how quickly the tires age and exhibit signs
of wear. Maintaining the correct tire pressure
helps keep tread wear evenly distributed.
To help prevent differences in tread depth and
wear patterns forming on the tires, the front and
rear wheels should be rotated, i.e. the front tires
moved to the rear and the rear tires moved to the
front. Ideally, tire rotation should be done the first
time after approximately 5000 km (ca
3100 miles) and thereafter at 10,000 km
(approx. 6200 miles) intervals.
If you have any questions regarding tread depth,
Volvo recommends consulting an authorized
Volvo workshop. If significant differences in wear
(> 1 mm difference in tread depth) between the
tires have already occurred, the least worn tires
should always be mounted on the rear wheels. A
front-wheel skid (understeer) is usually easier to
```
```
control than a rear-wheel skid (oversteer). If the
front wheels skid, the vehicle will continue in a
straight line instead of the rear wheels skidding
to the side, which could cause you to completely
lose control of the vehicle. It is therefore impor-
tant that the rear wheels never lose grip before
the front wheels.
```
```
Storing wheels and tires
When storing complete wheels (tires mounted on
rims), they should be suspended off the floor or
placed on their sides on the floor.
Tires not mounted on rims should be stored on
their sides or standing upright, but should not be
suspended.
```
```
CAUTION
Tires should preferably be stored in a cool,
dry, dark place, and should never be stored in
close proximity to solvents, gasoline, oils, etc.
```

WARNING
```
- The wheel and tire sizes for your Volvo
    are specified to meet stringent stability
    and handling requirements. Unapproved
    wheel/tire size combinations can nega-
    tively affect your vehicle's stability and
    handling.
- Any damage caused by installation of
    unapproved wheel/tire size combinations
    will not be covered by your new vehicle
    warranty. Volvo assumes no responsibility
    for death, injury, or expenses that may
    result from such installations.

```
Tire direction of rotation
Tires with tread designed to roll in only one
direction are marked with an arrow on the side-
wall.
```
```
The arrow shows the tire's direction of rotation.
```
- The tire should maintain the same direction
    of rotation throughout its service life.
- Tires should only be moved between the
    front and back, never from right to left or vice
    versa.
- Incorrectly mounted tires impair the vehicle's
    braking properties and ability to force aside
    rain, snow and slush.
- The tires with the most tread should always
    be mounted on the rear wheels to help
    reduce the risk of skidding.

```
NOTE
Use tires of the same type, dimensions and
make (manufacturer) on each axle.

Tread wear indicator
The tread wear indicator shows the status of the
tire's tread.

The tread wear indicator is a narrow elevated
strip running across the tire's longitudinal tread
grooves. The letters TWI (Tread Wear Indicator)
are visible on the side of the tire. When approxi-
mately 1.6 mm (1/16 inch) is left on the tread,
the tread will be at the same height as the tread
wear indicator. Replace the tire as soon as possi-
ble. Tires with low tread offer very poor traction in
rain or snow.

Tire terminology
The following is a glossary of tire-related terms.
The tire suppliers may have additional markings,
notes or warnings such as standard load, radial
tubeless, etc.
```
- Tire information placard: A placard show-
    ing the OE (Original Equipment) tire sizes,
    recommended inflation pressure, and the
    maximum weight the vehicle can carry.
- Tire Identification Number (TIN): A number
    on the sidewall of each tire providing infor-
    mation about the tire brand and manufactur-
    ing plant, tire size and date of manufacture.
- Inflation pressure: A measure of the
    amount of air in a tire.
- Standard load: A class of P-metric or Metric
    tires designed to carry a maximum load at 35
    psi [37 psi (2.5 bar) for Metric tires]. Increas-
    ing the inflation pressure beyond this pres-
    sure will not increase the tires load carrying
    capability.
- Extra load: A class of P-metric or Metric
    tires designed to carry a heavier maximum
    load at 41 psi [43 psi (2.9 bar) for Metric
    tires]. Increasing the inflation pressure
    beyond this pressure will not increase the
    tire's load carrying capability.
- kPa: Kilopascal, a metric unit of air pressure.
- PSI: Pounds per square inch, a standard unit
    of air pressure.
       - B-pillar: The structural member at the side
          of the vehicle behind the front door.
       - Bead area of the tire: Area of the tire next
          to the rim.
       - Sidewall of the tire: Area between the bead
          area and the tread.
       - Tread area of the tire: Area of the perime-
          ter of the tire that contacts the road when
          mounted on the vehicle.
       - Rim: The metal support (wheel) for a tire or a
          tire and tube assembly upon which the tire
          beads are seated.
       - Maximum load rating: a figure indicating
          the maximum load in pounds and kilograms
          that can be carried by the tire. This rating is
          established by the tire manufacturer.
       - Maximum permissible inflation pressure:
          the greatest amount of air pressure that

Tire sidewall designations
The following information can be found on a
tire's sidewall.
```
```
Federal law mandates that tire manufacturers
place standardized information on the sidewall of
all tires (see the illustration).
The vehicle has been certified with certain combi-
nations of wheels and tires.
The following information is listed on the tire
sidewall:
The tire designation:
```
```
NOTE
Please be aware that the following tire desig-
nation is an example only and that this par-
ticular tire may not be available on your vehi-
cle.
```
1. 215 : the width of the tire (in millimeters)
    from sidewall edge to sidewall edge. The
    larger the number, the wider the tire.
2. 65 : The ratio of the tire's height to its width
    in percent.
3. R: Radial tire (the designation RF and the
    symbol indicate that the vehicle is
    equipped with optional self-supporting run
    flat tires^3.
4. 15 : The diameter of the wheel rim (in
    inches).
5. 95 : The tire's load index. In this example, a
    load index of 95 equals a maximum load of
    1521 lbs (690 kg).
6. H: The tire's speed rating, or the maximum
    speed at which the tire is designed to be
    driven for extended periods of time, carrying
    a permissible load for the vehicle, and with
    correct inflation pressure. For example, H
    indicates a speed rating of 210 km/h
    (130 mph).

(^3) Self-supporting run flat tires may not be available on all models.

```
```
NOTE
The tire's load index and speed rating may
not appear on the sidewall because they are
not required by law.
```
7. M+S or M/S = Mud and Snow, AT = All Ter-
    rain, AS = All Season
8. U.S. DOT Tire Identification Number
    (TIN): This begins with the letters "DOT" and
    indicates that the tire meets all federal
    standards. The next two numbers are the
    factory code where the tire was manufac-
    tured, the next two are the tire size code and
    the last four numbers represent the week
    and year the tire was made. For example,
    0717 means that the tire was manufactured
    during week 7 of 2017. The numbers in
    between are marketing codes used at the
    manufacturer's discretion. This information
    helps a tire manufacturer identify a tire for
    safety recall purposes.
9. Tire Ply Composition and Material Used:
    Indicates the number of plies indicates or the
    number of layers of rubber-coated fabric in
    the tire tread and sidewall. Tire manufactur-
    ers also must indicate the ply materials in the
    tire and the sidewall, which include steel,
    nylon, polyester, and others.

10.Maximum Load: Indicates the maximum
load in pounds and kilograms that can be
carried by the tire. Refer to the vehicle's tire

```
information placard located on the B-Pillar
for the correct tire pressure for your vehicle.
11.Treadwear, Traction, and Temperature
grades.
12.Maximum permissible inflation pressure:
the greatest amount of air pressure that
should ever be put in the tire. This limit is set
by the tire manufacturer.
```
```
Speed Symbol
A tire's Speed Symbol (SS) indicates the maxi-
mum speed for which the tire has been certified
and should be at least equivalent to the vehicle's
top speed.
Winter tires, with or without studs, are exceptions
and may use a lower SS. When winter tires are
installed, the vehicle may not be driven faster
than the tires' SS.
The vehicle's speed should always be determined
by the posted speed limit and traffic and road
conditions, not the tire's SS.
The following table indicates the maximum per-
missible speed for each SS.
```
```
M 130 km/h (81 mph)
Q 160 km/h (100 mph)
```

Uniform Tire Quality Grading
ALL PASSENGER VEHICLE TIRES MUST
CONFORM TO FEDERAL SAFETY REQUIRE-
MENTS IN ADDITION TO THESE GRADES.
```
```
Quality grades can be found, where applica-
ble, on the tire sidewall between the tread
shoulder and maximum section width. For
example:
Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A
```
```
TREADWEAR
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a specified gov-
ernment test course. For example, a tire graded
150 would wear one and one half (1 ½) times as
well on the government course as a tire graded
```
100. The relative performance of tires depends
upon the actual conditions of their use, however,
and many depart significantly from the norm due
to variation in driving habits, maintenance practi-
ces and differences in road characteristics and
climate.

```
TRACTION
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are
AA, A, B, and C, as measured under controlled
conditions on specified government test surfaces
of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may
have poor traction performance.
```
```
WARNING
The traction grade assigned to this tire is
based on braking (straight-ahead) traction
tests and is not a measure of cornering (turn-
ing) traction.
```
```
TEMPERATURE
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B,
and C, representing the tire's resistance to the
generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat
when tested under controlled conditions on a
specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained
high temperature can cause the material of the
tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and exces-
sive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.
The grade C corresponds to a minimum level of
performance that all passenger vehicle tires must
meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard
No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performance on the laboratory test wheel than
the minimum required by law.
```
```
WARNING
The temperature grade for this tire is estab-
lished for a tire that is properly inflated and
not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-infla-
tion, or excessive loading, either separately or
in combination, can cause heat buildup and
tire failure.

Checking tire pressure
Correct inflation pressure helps improve driving
stability, save fuel and increase the service life of
the tires.

Tire pressure decreases over time, which is nor-
mal. Tire pressure also varies depending on the
ambient temperature. Driving on under-inflated
tires could cause the vehicle to overheat and lead
to damage. Tire pressure affects traveling com-
fort, road noise and driving characteristics.

Check the pressure in the tires every month. Use
the recommended inflation pressure for cold tires
for optimal tire performance and wear. Under-
inflated or over-inflated tires could cause uneven
tread wear.

Use an air pressure gauge and check the infla-
tion pressure on all the tires, including the spare
tire^4 , at least once a month and before long trips.
Volvo strongly recommends buying a reliable air
pressure gauge, as the automatic gauges provi-
ded at service stations may be inaccurate.

```
WARNING
```
- Under-inflation is the most common
    cause of tire failure and may result in
    severe tire cracking, tread separation, or
    "blow-out," with unexpected loss of vehi-
    cle control and increased risk of injury.
- Under-inflated tires reduce the load car-
    rying capacity of your vehicle.

```
Cold tires
Inflation pressure should be checked when the
tires are cold.
The tires are considered to be cold when they
have the same temperature as the surrounding
(ambient) air.
This temperature is normally reached after the
vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours.
After driving for approximately 1.6 km (1 mile),
the tires are considered to be warm. If you need
to drive longer than that to inflate the tires, check
and record the inflation pressure of the tires first
and inflate accordingly when you arrive at the
pump.
When the ambient temperature changes, so does
the inflation pressure. A 10-degree temperature
drop causes a corresponding drop in inflation
pressure of 1 psi (7 kPa). Check the inflation
pressure of the tires regularly and adjust to the
```
```
correct pressure, which can be found on the vehi-
cle's tire information placard or certification label.
If you check inflation pressure when the tires are
warm, you should never release air. The tires
become warm after driving and it is normal for
warm tires to have an inflation pressure above
the recommended pressure for cold tires. A warm
tire with an inflation pressure equal to or under
the recommended pressure for cold tires could
be significantly under-inflated.

Adjusting tire pressure
Tire pressure decreases over time, which is nor-
mal. The tire pressure must therefore be
adjusted to maintain the recommended tire pres-
sure.
Use the recommended inflation pressure for cold
tires for optimal tire performance and wear.
```
```
NOTE
To help prevent incorrect inflation pressure,
pressure should be checked when the tires
are cold. The tires are considered to be cold
when they have reached the same tempera-
ture as the ambient temperature (about 3
hours after the vehicle was last driven). After
driving for a few kilometers, the tires will warm
up and the pressure will increase.
```
1. Remove the valve cap from the tire and press
    the air pressure gauge firmly onto the valve.
2. Inflate to the recommended inflation pres-
    sure.
       3. Screw the valve cap back on.

```
NOTE
```
- After inflating a tire, always replace the
    valve cap to help prevent valve damage
    caused by gravel, dirt, etc.
- Use plastic valve caps only. Metal caps
    could corrode and become difficult to
    remove.
4. Visually inspect the tire to make sure there
are no nails or other embedded objects that
could puncture the tire and cause air leak-
age.
5. Check the sidewalls to make sure there are
no gouges, cuts, bulges or other irregulari-
ties.
6. Repeat this procedure for each tire, including
the spare tire^5.

```
NOTE
If you have overfilled the tire, release air by
pushing on the metal stem in the center of
the valve. Then recheck the pressure with
your tire gauge.
Some spare tires require higher inflation pres-
sure than the other tires. Consult the tire
inflation pressure table or the inflation pres-
sure placard.

Tire pressure monitoring system *
The tire pressure monitoring system, Tyre
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), provides a
warning symbol in the instrument panel if pres-
sure is too low in one or more tires.
Symbol Explanation
```
```
This symbol illuminates to indicate
low inflation pressure.
If there is a system malfunction, the
inflation pressure warning symbol
will flash for approximately one
minute and then glow steadily.
```
```
System description
The tire pressure monitoring system measures
differences in rotational speed between the
wheels through the ABS system to determine if
the tires are properly inflated. If inflation pressure
in a tire is too low, its diameter (and consequently
its rotational speed) changes. By comparing the
tires with each other, the system can determine if
the pressure in one or more tires is too low.
General information about the tire pressure
monitoring system
In the following description, the tire monitoring
system is generally referred to as TPMS.
Each tire, including the spare tire (if provided)^6 ,
should be checked monthly when cold and infla-
```
```
ted to the inflation pressure recommended by the
vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or
tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has
tires of a different size than the size indicated on
the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label,
you should determine the proper tire inflation
pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has
been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring
system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pres-
sure telltale when one or more of your tires is
significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the
low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should
stop and check your tires as soon as possible,
and inflate them to the proper pressure.
Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire cau-
ses the tire to overheat and can lead to tire fail-
ure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency
and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's
handling and stopping ability. Please note that
the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire main-
tenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to
maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-infla-
tion has not reached the level to trigger illumina-
tion of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a
TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the
system is not operating properly. The TPMS mal-
function indicator is combined with the low tire
pressure telltale. When the system detects a mal-

```
function, the telltale will flash for approximately
one minute and then remain continuously illumi-
nated. This sequence will continue upon subse-
quent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunc-
tion exists. When the malfunction indicator is illu-
minated, the system may not be able to detect or
signal low tire pressure as intended.
TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of
reasons, including the installation of replacement
or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that
prevent the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after
replacing one or more tires or wheels on your
vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alter-
nate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to con-
tinue to function properly.
```
```
Messages in the instrument panel
If tire pressure is too low, the low tire pressure
warning symbol is shown in the instrument panel
along with a message.
```
- Tire pressure low Check tires, calibrate
    after fill
- Tire pressure system^ Temporarily
    unavailable

```
To keep in mind
```
- Always calibrate the system after changing
    wheels or adjusting tire pressure. See the tire

```
pressure placard on the driver's side B pillar
for Volvo-recommended tire pressures.
```
- If you switch to a tire of another size than the
    factory-mounted tires, the system must be
    calibrated for these tires to avoid false warn-
    ings.
- If a spare wheel

(^7) is used, it is possible that
the tire pressure monitoring system will not
work correctly due to the differences
between the wheels.

- The system does not replace the need for
    regular tire inspection and maintenance.
- It is not possible to deactivate the tire pres-
    sure monitoring system.

Calibrating the tire pressure
monitoring system *****

In order for the tire pressure monitoring system,
Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), to
function correctly, tire pressure reference values
must be set correctly. This must be done each
time the tires are changed or the tire pressure is
adjusted.

For example, when driving with a heavy load or at
high speeds (over 160 km/h (100 mph)), tire
pressure should be adjusted to the Volvo-recom-
mended tire pressure values. The system should
then be recalibrated.

1. Switch off the ignition.
2. Inflate the tires to the pressure indicated on
    the tire pressure placard on the driver's side
    B pillar.
3. Start the vehicle.
4. Open the Car status app in App view.
    5. Tap TPMS.

```
NOTE
The car must be stationary when calibration is
started.
```
6. Tap Calibrate.
7. Tap OK to confirm that the tire pressure in
    all four tires has been checked and adjusted.
       8. Run the car until calibration is complete.
          Calibration is done when the vehicle is driv-
          ing at a speed above 35 km/h (22 mph).
          > When enough data has been collected for
             the system to detect low tire pressure, the
             color of the tire symbols in the center dis-
             play will change from gray to green. The
             system will not provide any other confir-
             mation that calibration has been comple-
             ted.
             If the car's ignition is switched off before
             calibration is complete, the tires in the
             center display change color from gray to
             green upon next start-up, even if calibra-
             tion is not complete. Perform the calibra-
             tion again and allow it to complete within
             the same operating cycle to ensure that
             the calibration is carried out correctly.
             If start-up of calibration fails, the following
             message appears: Calibration
             unsuccessful. Try again..

sure and inflate if necessary.
```
1. Switch off the ignition.
2. Check the inflation pressure on all four tires
    using a tire pressure gauge.
3. Inflate the tire to the correct pressure (see
    the tire pressure decal on the driver's side
    door pillar).
4. Through calibration of the system via the
    center display after the tire pressure has
    been adjusted.
    Please be aware that the indicator symbol
    will not go out until the low tire pressure has
    been corrected and the system has been
    recalibrated.

```
NOTE
To help prevent incorrect inflation pressure,
pressure should be checked when the tires
are cold. The tires are considered to be cold
when they have reached the same tempera-
ture as the ambient temperature (about 3
hours after the vehicle was last driven). After
driving for a few kilometers, the tires will warm
up and the pressure will increase.
```
```
NOTE
```
- After inflating a tire, always replace the
    valve cap to help prevent valve damage
    caused by gravel, dirt, etc.
- Use plastic valve caps only. Metal caps
    could corrode and become difficult to
    remove.

Spare wheel^11
The spare wheel is a Temporary spare and can
be used to temporarily replace a punctured tire
on one of the vehicle's regular wheels.
The spare tire is only intended for temporary use.
Replace it with a normal wheel as soon as possi-
ble.
The driving characteristics of the vehicle change
and ground clearance reduces when the spare
wheel is used. Do not wash the vehicle in an
automatic car wash while using the Temporary
Spare.
The recommended tire pressure must be main-
tained regardless of at which position the tempo-
rary spare wheel is used on the vehicle.
If the spare wheel is damaged, a new one can be
purchased from a Volvo retailer.
```
```
WARNING
Current legislation prohibits the use of the
"Temporary Spare" tire other than as a tem-
porary replacement for a punctured tire. It
must be replaced as soon as possible by a
standard tire. Road holding and handling may
be affected with the "Temporary Spare" in
use. Do not drive faster than 80 km/h
(50 mph).
```
(^11) Not available on all models.

```
WARNING
```
- The vehicle must never be driven with
    more than one "Temporary spare" tire
    mounted.
- Driving with a spare wheel may alter the
    driving characteristics of the vehicle.
    Replace the spare wheel with a normal
    wheel as soon as possible.
- The spare wheel is smaller than the nor-
    mal wheel, which affects the vehicle's
    ground clearance. Watch for high curbs
    and do not wash the vehicle in an auto-
    matic car wash when a spare wheel is
    mounted.
- Follow the manufacturer's recommended
    tire inflation pressure for the spare wheel.
- On all-wheel drive vehicles, the drive on
    the rear axle can be disconnected.
- If the spare wheel is mounted on the
    front axle, snow chains must not be used.
- The spare wheel must not be repaired.

```
CAUTION
The vehicle must not be driven with wheels of
different dimensions or with a spare tire other
than the one that came with the vehicle. The
use of different size wheels can seriously
damage your vehicle's transmission.
```
```
This illustration is general. The shape and design of the
foam block may vary depending on vehicle model.
The spare wheel is located in the spare wheel
well with the outside of the wheel facing down-
ward. The same bolt runs through both the spare
wheel and foam block to hold them into place.

Snow tires
Snow tires are designed for winter driving.

Volvo recommends snow tires with specific
dimensions. The tire dimensions vary depending
on engine type. When driving with snow tires, the
correct type of tires must be mounted on all four
wheels.

```
NOTE
Contact a Volvo dealer for advice on the best
choice of rims and tires.
```
Tips for changing snow tires
When switching between regular tires and snow
tires, mark the tires according to which side they
were mounted on, e.g. L for left and R for right.

Studded tires
Studded tires should be broken in by driving
500–1000 km (300–600 miles) slowly and gen-
tly to help the studs settle properly in the tires.
This gives the tire, and especially the studs, a
longer service life.

```
NOTE
Regulations regarding the use of studded
tires vary from country to country.
```
```
Tread depth
Road conditions with ice, slush and low tempera-
tures place considerably higher demands on tires
than summer conditions. Volvo therefore recom-
mends not driving on snow tires that have a tread
depth of less than 4 mm (0.15 inch).
```
```
Related information
```
- When changing wheels (p. 522)
- Winter driving (p. 425)
- Tread wear indicator (p. 511)

```
Snow chains
Using snow chains and/or snow tires can help
improve traction in winter driving conditions.
WARNING
Use Volvo genuine snow chains or equivalent
snow chains that are suitable for the vehicle
model and the tire and wheel sizes. Only one-
sided snow chains are permitted.
If uncertain about snow chains, Volvo recom-
mends contacting an authorized Volvo work-
shop. Use of the wrong snow chains could
cause serious damage to the vehicle and
result in an accident.
```

## ||

## WHEELS AND TIRES

530

```
CAUTION
Snow chains can be used on the vehicle, with
the following restrictions:
```
- Volvo recommends not using snow
    chains on wheel dimensions larger than
    18 inches.
- Always follow the manufacturer's installa-
    tion instructions carefully. Install chains
    as tightly as possible and retighten peri-
    odically.
- Only put snow chains on the front wheels
    (also applies to all-wheel drive vehicles).
- If accessory, aftermarket or "custom"
    tires and wheels with different dimen-
    sions than the original tires and wheels
    are used, snow chains in some cases
    may NOT be used. Sufficient distance
    between the chains and brakes, suspen-
    sion and body components must be
    maintained.
- Check local regulations regarding the use
    of snow chains before installing.
- Never exceed the snow chain manufac-
    turer's specified maximum speed limit.
    Under no circumstances should you
    exceed 50 km/h (30 mph).
- Avoid bumps, holes or sharp turns when
    driving with snow chains.
       - Avoid driving on surfaces without snow as
          this wears out both the snow chains and
          the tires.
       - The handling of the vehicle can be
          adversely affected when driving with
          chains. Avoid fast or sharp turns as well
          as locked wheel braking.
       - Some types of strap-on chains affect
          brake components and therefore must
          NOT be used.

```
Consult a Volvo retailer for more information
about snow chains.

Tire sealing system^12
The temporary tire sealing system can be used
to seal a puncture in a tire or to check and
adjust the pressure in the tire.
Models equipped with a spare wheel^13 do not
have the tire sealing system.
```
```
The tire sealing system consists of a compressor
and a bottle containing sealing compound. The
sealing functions as a temporary repair.
```
```
NOTE
The sealing compound effectively seals tires
with punctures in the tread but may not be
able to fully seal tires with punctures in the
sidewall. Do not use the tire sealing system
on tires with large tears, cracks or similar
damage.
```
```
NOTE
The compressor is intended for temporary tire
sealing and is approved by Volvo.
```
```
Location
The tire sealing system is located in a foam block
under the floor of the trunk.

Capacity weight
All weight added to the curb weight, including
cargo and optional equipment. When towing, tow-
bar weight is also part of cargo weight.
Permissible axle weight
The maximum allowable weight that can be car-
ried by a single axle (front or rear). These num-
bers are shown on the Federal/Canadian Motor
Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS/CMVSS) label.
The total load on each axle must never exceed its
maximum permissible weight.
Gross vehicle weight (GVW)
The vehicle's curb weight + cargo + passengers.
```
```
Steps for Determining Correct Load
Limit
```
1. Locate the statement "the combined weight
    of occupants and cargo should never exceed
    XXX kg or XXX lbs." on your vehicle's plac-
    ard.
2. Determine the combined weight of the driver
    and passengers that will be riding in your
    vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight of the driver
    and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
4. The resulting figure equals the available
    amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.
    For example, if the "XXX" amount equals
    1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb. pas-
    sengers in your vehicle, the amount of availa-
    ble cargo and luggage load capacity is 650
    lbs. (1400 - 750 (5 × 150) = 650 lbs.)
5. Determine the combined weight of luggage
    and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That
    weight may not safely exceed the available
    cargo and luggage load capacity calculated
    in Step 4.
6. If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load
    from your trailer will be transferred to your
    vehicle. Consult this manual to determine
    how this reduces the available cargo and lug-
    gage load capacity of your vehicle.

```
WARNING
```
- Exceeding the permissible axle weight,
    gross vehicle weight, or any other weight
    rating limits can cause tire overheating
    resulting in permanent deformation or
    catastrophic failure.
- Do not use replacement tires with lower
    load carrying capacities than the tires that
    were original equipment on the vehicle
    because this will lower the vehicle's GVW
    rating. Use only tires with the correct load
    carrying capacity. Consult your Volvo
    retailer for information.

```
Loading recommendations
There are a number of things to consider when
carrying loads in or on the vehicle.
Load-carrying capacity is determined by the vehi-
cle's curb weight. The total weight of all passen-
gers and any installed accessories reduces the
vehicle's load-carrying capacity by the corres-
ponding amount.
```
```
WARNING
The vehicle's driving characteristics change
depending on the weight and position of the
load.
```
```
Loading in the trunk and cargo
compartment
```
- Position objects so they are pressing against
    the rear seat backrests.
- Distribute the load evenly.
- Heavy objects should be positioned as low
    as possible. Avoid placing heavy objects on
    folded-down seat backrests.
- Cover sharp corners with a soft cloth or simi-
    lar to help prevent damage to the upholstery.
- Use the load anchoring eyelets and tension-
    ing straps or similar to secure all objects.

```
WARNING
In a head-on collision at a speed of 50 km/h
(30 mph), an unsecured object weighing 20
kg (44 pounds) can reach a projectile weight
equivalent to 1000 kg (2200 pounds).
```
```
WARNING
If objects are loaded higher than the upper
edge of the side windows, leave a 10 cm (4
in.) space between the objects and the win-
dow. Objects placed closer to this could
impede the function of the inflatable curtain
concealed inside the headlining.
```
```
WARNING
Always secure the load. Otherwise, it may shift
during heavy braking and injure people in the
vehicle.
Cover sharp edges and sharp corners with
something soft.
Turn off the engine and apply the parking
brake when loading/unloading long objects.
Otherwise, it is possible for the load to reach
the gear lever or gear selector and move it to
a drive position – which could cause the vehi-
cle to begin rolling.

are available from authorized Volvo retailers.
Carefully follow the installation instructions provi-
ded with the load carriers.
```
- Check periodically to ensure that the load
    carriers and load are properly secured.
    Secure the load firmly using tie straps or
    similar.
- Distribute the load evenly throughout the
    load carriers. Place heavier cargo at the bot-
    tom of the load.
- The vehicle's wind resistance and fuel con-
    sumption increase with the size of the load.
- Drive smoothly. Avoid rapid acceleration, hard
    braking and fast cornering.

```
WARNING
The vehicle's center of gravity and driving
characteristics are altered by roof loads.

```
Volvo's service program
To keep the vehicle as safe and reliable as pos-
sible, follow the Volvo service schedule speci-
fied in the Warranty and Maintenance Records
Information booklet.
```
```
Volvo recommends having an authorized Volvo
workshop perform service and maintenance.
Volvo workshops have the staff, service literature
and special tools to guarantee the highest quality
of service.
```
```
CAUTION
To ensure the Volvo warranty is not invalida-
ted, check and follow the Service and War-
ranty Booklet.
```
```
Introduction
The maintenance services contain several checks
that require special instruments and tools and
therefore must be performed by a qualified tech-
nician. To keep your Volvo in top condition, spec-
ify time-tested and proven Genuine Volvo Parts
and Accessories.
The Federal Clean Air Act - U.S.
The Federal Clean Air Act requires vehicle manu-
facturers to furnish written instructions to the ulti-
mate purchaser to assure the proper servicing
and function of the components that control
emissions. These services, which are listed in the
"Warranty and Service Records Information"
```
```
booklet, are not covered by the warranty. You will
be required to pay for labor and material used.
Maintenance
Your Volvo passed several major inspections
before it was delivered to you, in accordance with
Volvo specifications. The maintenance proce-
dures outlined in the Warranty and Service
Records Information booklet, many of which will
positively affect your vehicle's emissions, should
be performed as indicated. It is recommended
that receipts for vehicle emission maintenance be
retained in case questions arise concerning
maintenance. Inspection and maintenance should
also be performed anytime a malfunction is
observed or suspected.
Applicable warranties - U.S./Canada
In accordance with applicable U.S. and Canadian
regulations, the following list of warranties is pro-
vided.
```
- New Vehicle Limited Warranty
- Parts and Accessories Limited Warranty
- Corrosion Protection Limited Warranty
- Seat Belt and Supplemental Restraint Sys-
    tems Limited Warranty
- Emission Design and Defect Warranty
- Emission Performance Warranty
These are federal warranties. Other warranties
are provided as required by state/provincial law.
Refer to your separate Warranty and Service

```
Records Information booklet for detailed informa-
tion concerning each of the warranties.
Periodic maintenance helps minimize
emissions
```
```
NOTE
```
- Refer to your Service and Warranty Book-
    let for a comprehensive service and main-
    tenance schedule up to 240,000 km
    (150,000 miles). This program contains
    inspections and services necessary for
    the proper function of your vehicle and
    includes components that affect vehicle
    emissions.
- The Warranty and Service Records Infor-
    mation booklet also contains detailed
    information concerning the warranties
    that apply to your vehicle.

```
On-board Diagnostic System
OBD II is part of your vehicle's computerized
engine management system. It stores diagnostic
information about your vehicle's emission con-
trols. It can light the Check Engine light (MIL) if it
detects an emission control "fault." A "fault" is a
component or system that is not performing
within an expected range. A fault may be perma-
nent or temporary. OBD II will store a message
about any fault.
```

## MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE



```
549
```
Emission inspection readiness

How do states use OBD II for emission
inspections?
Many states connect a computer directly to a
vehicle's OBD II system. The inspector can then
read "faults." In some states, this type of inspec-
tion has replaced the tailpipe emission test.

How can my vehicle fail OBD II emission
inspection?
Your vehicle can fail OBD II emission inspection
for any of the following reasons:

- If your Check Engine (MIL) light is lit, your
    vehicle may fail inspection.
- If your vehicle's Check Engine light was lit,
    but went out without any action on your part,
    OBD II will still have a recorded fault. Your
    vehicle may pass or fail, depending on the
    inspection practices in your area.
- If you had recent service that required dis-
    connecting the battery, OBD II diagnostic
    information may be incomplete and "not
    ready" for inspection. A vehicle that is not
    ready may fail inspection.

How can I prepare for my next OBD II
emission inspection?

- If your Check Engine (MIL) light is lit - or was
    lit but went out without service, have your

```
vehicle diagnosed and, if necessary, serviced
by a qualified Volvo technician.
```
- If you recently had service for a lit Check
    Engine light, or if you had service that
    required disconnecting the battery, a period
    of driving is necessary to bring the OBD II
    system to "ready" for inspection. Two half-
    hour trips of mixed stop-and-go/highway
    driving are typically needed to allow OBD II to
    reach readiness. Your Volvo retailer can pro-
    vide you with more information on planning a
    trip.
- Maintain your vehicle in accordance with your
    vehicle's maintenance schedule.

```
Owner maintenance
Periodic maintenance requirements and intervals
are described in your vehicle's Warranty and
Service Records Information booklet.
The following points can be carried out between
the normally scheduled maintenance services.
Each time the car is refueled:
```
- Check the engine oil level.
- Clean the windshield, windshield wipers,
    headlights, and taillights.

```
Monthly:
```
- Check cold tire pressure in all tires. Inspect
    the tires for wear.
- Check that engine coolant and other fluid
    levels are between the indicated "min" and
    "max" markings.
- Clean interior glass surfaces with a glass
    cleaner and soft paper towels.
- Wipe driver information displays with a soft
    cloth.
- Visually inspect battery terminals for corro-
    sion. Corrosion may indicate a loose terminal
    connector, or a battery near the end of its
    useful service life. Consult your Volvo retailer
    for additional information.
As needed:
Wash the car, including the undercarriage, to
reduce wear that can be caused by a buildup of
dirt, and corrosion that can be caused by salt res-
idues.
Clean leaves and twigs from air intake vents at
the base of the windshield, and from other places
where they may collect.

Data transfer between vehicle and
workshop over Wi-Fi
Volvo workshops have a designated Wi-Fi net-
work for secure data transfer between your vehi-
cle and the workshop. Your visit to the workshop
will be easier and more effective when diagnos-
tics information and software can be transferred
over the workshop's network.
When you arrive at the workshop, your technician
can connect your vehicle to the workshop's Wi-Fi
network to perform troubleshooting and down-
load software. For this type of communication,
the vehicle only connects to the workshop's net-
work. The vehicle can only be connected to the
designated workshop networks, not to any other
network, e.g. your home network.
```
```
Manual connection to workshop Wi-Fi
Manual connection is usually performed by a
service technician. Because the technician uses
the buttons on your remote key to connect the
vehicle, it is important that you bring a key with
buttons when taking the vehicle in to a workshop.
Pressing the lock button on the remote key three
times will connect the vehicle to the workshop's
Wi-Fi network.
When the car is connected to a Wi-Fi network,
the symbol appears in the center display.
```

WARNING
The vehicle may not be driven when it is con-
nected to the workshop's networks and sys-
tems.

Hoisting the vehicle
When hoisting the vehicle, it is important to
ensure the jack/vehicle hoist is correctly
engaged in the designated attachment points
under the vehicle.

For vehicles with self-leveling*, pneumatic sus-
pension (if installed) must be turned off before
the vehicle is lifted. Turning off the function in the
center display.

```
WARNING
If the vehicle is lifted on a garage jack, the
jack must be placed under one of the four lift-
ing points. Make sure that the vehicle is cor-
rectly positioned on the jack and that it can-
not slide off. Make sure the jack plate has a
rubber pad to help keep the vehicle stable
and prevent damage. Always use axle stands
or similar.
```
```
NOTE
Volvo recommends only using the jack
intended for your specific vehicle model. If a
jack other than that recommended by Volvo is
used, follow the instructions included with the
equipment.
The vehicle's ordinary jack is only intended to
be used in temporary situations for short peri-
ods of time, such as when changing wheels in
the event of a flat tire. If the vehicle needs to
be lifted more frequently, or for a longer
period of time than for a wheel change, a
garage jack or hoist is recommended. Always
follow the instructions for use provided with
the equipment.

## MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE

560

```
If the engine oil is not checked regularly and the
level becomes low, this could cause serious
engine damage.
```
```
CAUTION
To satisfy the requirements for the engine's
service intervals, all engines are factory-filled
with a specially adapted synthetic engine oil.
Great care has been put into the choice of oil,
with consideration given to service life, starta-
bility, fuel consumption and environmental
impact.
For the recommended service intervals to
apply, an approved engine oil must be used.
Only use the prescribed oil grade to top off or
change the oil. Otherwise, there is a risk of
the vehicle's service life, startability, fuel con-
sumption and environmental impact being
affected.
Failure to use engine oil of the prescribed
grade and viscosity could cause damage to
engine-related components. Volvo Car Corpo-
ration disclaims warranty liability for such type
of damage.
Volvo recommends entrusting oil changes to
an authorized Volvo workshop.
```
```
Volvo uses different systems to warn if the oil
level is too low/high or the oil pressure is low. On
engine variants with an oil pressure sensor, a
```
```
warning symbol is displayed in the instrument
panel when oil pressure is low. On engine
variants with an oil level sensor, the warn-
ing symbol in the instrument panel and display
messages are used to alert the driver. Some
engine variants have both systems. Contact a
Volvo retailer for more information.
Change the engine oil and oil filter according to
the schedule specified in the Warranty and Main-
tenance Records Information booklet. Oils of a
higher grade than that specified may be used. If
the vehicle is driven in adverse conditions, Volvo
recommends using an oil with a higher grade
than that specified.

Refilling coolant
Coolant helps keep the combustion engine at
the right operating temperature. The heat trans-
ferred from the engine to the coolant can be
used to warm the passenger compartment.
```
```
When refilling coolant, follow the instructions on
the package. Never fill the cooling system with
only water. The risk of freezing is increased with
too low or too high amounts of coolant.
If there is coolant under the vehicle, smoke from
the cooling system, or if more than 2 liters (about
2 quarts) of coolant has been added to the sys-
tem, there could be something wrong with the
cooling system and starting the vehicle could
damage the engine. Call a tow truck and do not
attempt to start the engine.
```
```
WARNING
The coolant may be very hot. Never unscrew
the cap when the coolant is hot. If coolant
must be filled, unscrew the expansion tank
cap slowly to relieve overpressure.
```
```
Coolant expansion tank, left-hand drive vehicle.

563
```
```
Unscrew the cover in the plastic covering.
```
```
Unscrew the expansion tank cap and fill
coolant as needed. The level should not
exceed the yellow MAX mark inside the
expansion tank.
```
Put the components back in place in the reverse
order.

```
CAUTION
```
- Mix the coolant with water of acceptable
    quality. If you are unsure of the quality of
    the water, use a Volvo-recommended
    premixed coolant.
- Make sure the coolant mixture is 50%
    water and 50% coolant.
- Only use coolants with corrosion protec-
    tion recommended by Volvo.
- To help ensure sufficient corrosion pro-
    tection in the system, only use new cool-
    ant when replacing larger components in
    the cooling system.
- Never run the engine unless the cooling
    system is properly filled. An improperly
    filled cooling system could lead to high
    temperatures and cracks in the cylinder
    heads.
- High levels of chlorine, chlorides and
    other salts may cause corrosion in the
    cooling system.

Start battery
The vehicle has a single-pole electrical system
that uses the chassis and engine mount as con-
ductors.

The start battery is used to start the electrical
system and power the starter motor and other
electrical equipment in the vehicle.

The start battery should only be replaced by a
workshop^18.

The vehicle has a voltage-regulated alternating
current generator.

The starter battery is a 12 V battery, designed for
the carbon dioxide reducing functions Start/Stop
and regenerative charging, and to support the
functionality of the car's different systems.

The service life and performance of the start bat-
tery are affected by factors such as driving style,
driving conditions, climate, battery discharges,
number of starts, etc.

- Never disconnect the start battery while the
    engine is running.
- Make sure the cables to the start battery are
    correctly connected and the clamps are
    securely tightened.

```
WARNING
```
- Batteries generate hydrogen gas, which
    is flammable and explosive.
- Do not connect the jumper cable to any
    part of the fuel system or to any moving
    parts. Avoid touching hot manifolds.
- Battery fluid contains sulfuric acid. Do not
    allow battery fluid to contact eyes, skin,
    fabrics or painted surfaces.
- If contact occurs, flush the affected area
    immediately with water. Obtain medical
    help immediately if eyes are affected.
- Never expose the battery to open flame
    or electric spark. Do not smoke near the
    battery. Failure to follow the instructions
    for jump starting can lead to injury.

```

WARNING
PROPOSITION 65 WARNING
Battery posts, terminals, and related accesso-
ries contain lead and lead compounds, chemi-
cals known to the state of California to cause
cancer and reproductive harm. Wash hands
after handling.
```
```
Use the vehicle's connection points in the engine
compartment to connect an external start battery
or battery charger.
The battery terminals on the car's starter battery
in the luggage/cargo area must not be used.
If the start battery is being charged, the support
battery will also be charged.

## MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE

574

```
CAUTION
Only a modern battery charger with controlled
charge voltage should be used to charge the
starter battery and support battery. The rapid
charging function should not be used as this
could damage the battery.
```
```
CAUTION
Failure to observe the following could cause
the infotainment energy save mode to tempo-
rarily stop working and/or a message in the
driver's display regarding the state of charge
of the starter battery may be temporarily
incorrect after an external starter battery or
battery charger has been connected:
```
- The negative battery terminal of the vehi-
    cle's starter battery must never be used
    to connect an external starter battery or
    battery charger – only the vehicle's neg-
    ative charging point should be used as
    a grounding point.

```
NOTE
If the starter battery becomes discharged too
many times, it will shorten its service life.
The service life of the starter battery is affec-
ted by several factors, such as driving condi-
tions and climate. The starting capacity of the
battery reduces gradually over time. The bat-
tery must therefore be recharged if the vehi-
cle is not used or a long period of time or if it
is only driven short distances. Severe cold fur-
ther limits the starting capacity.
To keep the starter battery in a good condi-
tion, the vehicle should be driven at least
15 minutes per week or the battery should be
connected to a battery charger with automatic
trickle charging.
A starter battery that is always kept fully
charged has the maximum service life.
```
```
Location
```
```
The start battery is located in the trunk.
```
```
WARNING
If the starter battery is disconnected, the func-
tion for automatic opening and closing must
be reset to function correctly. A reset is
required in order for the pinch protection to
work.
```
```
CAUTION
On certain models, the battery is secured with
a tensioning strap. Make sure that the ten-
sioning strap is always securely tightened.

```
Support battery
In addition to the start battery, vehicles equipped
with the Start/Stop function also have a support
battery.
```
```
Vehicles with the Start/Stop function are equip-
ped with two 12-volt batteries ‒ a heavy-duty
start battery and a support battery that provides
extra current during the Start/Stop function's
start sequence.
```
```
The support battery is located in a box next to the spring
strut in the engine compartment.
```
```
NOTE
```
- The higher the current consumption in
    the vehicle, the more the alternator has to
    work and the batteries have to be
    charged = increased fuel consumption.
- When the starter battery capacity has
    dropped below the lowest permissible
    level, the Start/Stop function is disen-
    gaged.

```
When the Start/Stop function is temporarily
reduced due to high current consumption:
```
- The engine will auto-start, even if the driver
    does not lift their foot from the brake pedal.
The support battery does not normally require
more service than the start battery. If you have
any questions or concerns, consult a workshop ‒
an authorized Volvo workshop is recommended.

```
CAUTION
If the following is not observed, the Start/
Stop function may temporarily stop working
after connection of an external starter battery
or battery charger:
```
- The negative battery terminal of the vehi-
    cle's starter battery must never be used
    to connect an external starter battery or
    battery charger – only the vehicle's neg-
    ative charging point should be used as
    a grounding point.


## MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE



```
577
```
```
NOTE
If the starter battery is discharged to the
extent that the vehicle does not have normal
electrical functions and the engine must then
be jump-started with an external battery or a
battery charger, the Start/Stop function may
remain activated. If the Start/Stop function
shortly thereafter auto-stops the engine, there
is a huge risk that auto-start of the engine will
fail due to insufficient battery capacity since
the battery had not had time to recharge.
If the vehicle has been jump-started or if
there has not been enough time for the bat-
tery to be charged with a battery charger, it is
advisable to temporarily deactivate the
Start/Stop function until the battery has been
recharged by the vehicle. At an ambient tem-
perature of about +15°C (about 60°F), the
battery must be charged by the vehicle for at
least one hour. At lower ambient tempera-
tures, the charging time can increase to
3-4 hours. It is advisable to charge the battery
with an external battery charger.

Cleaning the interior
Only use cleaning agents and car care products
recommended by Volvo. Clean regularly and
treat stains immediately for best results. It is
important to vacuum before using a cleaning
agent.
```
```
CAUTION
```
- Some colored clothing (for example, dark
    jeans and suede garments) may stain the
    upholstery. If this occurs, it is important to
    clean and treat these parts of the uphols-
    tery as soon as possible.
- Never use strong solvents such as
    washer fluid, gasoline, mineral spirit or
    concentrated alcohol to clean the interior
    as this can damage the upholstery as
    well as other interior materials.
- Never spray cleaning agent directly onto
    components that have electrical buttons
    and controls. Wipe instead with a damp
    cloth with cleaning agent.
- Sharp objects and Velcro can damage

WARNING
```
- Never use more than one inlay mat at a
    time on the driver's floor. If any other type
    of floor mat is used, remove the original
    mat from the driver's seat floor before
    driving. All types of mats must be securely
    anchored in the attachment points in the
    floor. Make sure the floor mat does not
    impede the movement of the brake pedal
    or accelerator pedal in any way, as this
    could be a serious safety hazard.
- Volvo's floor mats are specially manufac-
    tured for your vehicle. They must be prop-
    erly secured in the attachment points in
    the floor to help ensure they cannot slide
    and become trapped under the pedals.

After vacuuming, a specially designed textile
cleaning agent should be used to remove stains
on floor mats. Floor mats should be cleaned with
products recommended by Volvo retailers.

```
Leather upholstery*
Volvo's leather upholstery is treated to protect its
original appearance. Over time, sunlight, grease,
dirt, etc. could break down the protective layer.
This could result in scratches and cracking.
Leather upholstery is a natural product that
changes and acquires a beautiful patina over
time. Regular cleaning and treatments are
required to preserve the qualities and color of the
leather. Volvo offers a comprehensive product,
Volvo Leather Care Kit/Wipes, for cleaning and
treating leather upholstery that, when used as
directed, preserves the leather's protective coa-
ting.
For best results, Volvo recommends cleaning and
applying protective cream one to four times a
year (or more as needed). Volvo Leather Care Kit
951 0251 and Volvo Leather Softener 943
7429 are available for purchase at Volvo retailers.

Cleaning the leather upholstery
```
1. Apply the leather cleaner to a damp sponge
    and squeeze it until the cleaner foams.
2. Move the sponge in circular motions to apply
    the foam to the stain.
3. Dampen the stain thoroughly with the
    sponge. Let the sponge absorb the stain and
    do not rub.
4. Dry the stain using a soft towel and let the
    leather dry completely.
Protecting the leather upholstery
1. Apply a small amount of leather protector to
    a cloth and then apply the protector to the
    leather using light circular movements.
2. Let it dry for approximately 20 minutes.
Protecting the leather upholstery makes it better
able to withstand sunlight's harmful UV rays.

```
Polishing and waxing
Polish and wax the vehicle when the paint is
matte or to provide extra protection. The vehicle
does not need to be polished until it is at least a
year old. However, it can be waxed during the
first year. Do not polish or wax the vehicle in
direct sunlight. The surface of the vehicle should
not be warmer than approximately 45 °C
(113 °F).
```
- Wash and dry the vehicle very carefully
    before polishing or waxing. Remove asphalt
    and tar stains with asphalt remover or paint
    thinner. More stubborn stains can be
    removed with a grinding paste designed for
    vehicle paint.
- Use polish first and then liquid or paste wax.
    Follow the instructions on the package care-
    fully. Many products contain both polish and
    wax.
- A wide range of polymer-based waxes can
    be purchased today. These waxes are easy to
    use and produce a long-lasting, high-gloss
    finish that protects the bodywork against oxi-
    dation, road dirt and fading.

```
CAUTION
Avoid waxing and polishing plastic and rubber.
If using degreaser on plastic and rubber, only
rub (if necessary) with slight pressure. Use a
soft sponge.
Polishing glossy trim moldings can wear away
or damage the glossy surface layer.
Polish containing abrasives must not be used.
```
```
CAUTION
Only use paintwork treatments recommended
by Volvo. Other treatments, such as preserva-
tion, sealing, protection, luster sealing or simi-
lar, could damage the paintwork. Paintwork
damage caused by such treatments are not
covered by Volvo's warranty.

```
```
Hand washing
Keep the following points in mind when washing
the vehicle:
```
- Avoid washing the vehicle in direct sunlight.
    This could cause the detergent or wax to dry
    out and become abrasive.
- Remove bird droppings from paintwork as
    soon as possible. They contain chemicals
    that affect and discolor paint very quickly.
    Use e.g. soft paper or a sponge soaked in
    lots of water. Consult an authorized Volvo
    workshop for assistance removing discolora-
    tion.
- Hose down the underbody, including the
    wheel housings and bumper.
- Hose down the entire vehicle and remove
    any loose dirt, droppings etc. to reduce the
    risk of scratches from washing. Do not spray
    directly onto locks.
- If necessary, use cold degreaser on heavily
    soiled surfaces. Note that in such cases the
    surfaces must not be hot from the sun.


## MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE

```
597
```
- Wash using a sponge, car washing detergent
    and plenty of lukewarm water.
- Clean the wiper blades with lukewarm soap
    solution or car washing detergent.
- Dry the vehicle using a clean, soft chamois or
    a squeegee. Try not to let drops of water dry
    in strong sunlight. This could cause water
    drying stains that may need to be polished
    out.
- In areas with heavy industrial emissions,
    more frequent washing of the vehicle's exte-
    rior is recommended.
- Tar spots from asphalt may remain even after
    washing. Use a tar remover to remove these
    spots after washing the vehicle.

```
WARNING
Always entrust engine washing to a workshop.
If the engine is hot, there is a risk of fire.
```
```
CAUTION
Dirty headlights do not work as well. Clean
them regularly, e.g. when refueling.
Do not use corrosive cleaners. Use water and
a non-abrasive sponge.
```
```
NOTE
Exterior lighting such as headlights and tail-
lights may develop temporary condensation
on the inside of the lens. This is normal. All
exterior lighting is designed to resist this.
Condensation is normally vented out of the
lamp housing once the light has been lit for
some period of time.
```
```
CAUTION
```
- Make sure that the panoramic roof and
    sun shade are closed before washing the
    vehicle.
- Never use abrasive polishing agents on
    the panoramic roof.
- Never use wax on the rubber seals
    around the panoramic roof.

```
CAUTION
Remember to remove dirt from the drain
holes in the doors and sills after washing the
vehicle.

```
```
Automatic car washes
An automatic car wash is a fast and easy way to
keep your vehicle clean, but it does not reach all
areas of the vehicle. For best results, Volvo rec-
ommends hand washing your vehicle or supple-
menting automatic car washes with a hand wash.
```
```
NOTE
Volvo recommends not washing the vehicle in
an automatic car wash during the first few
months; the paintwork on new vehicles takes
some time to fully harden.
```
```
CAUTION
Before driving the vehicle into a car wash,
deactivate the Automatic Braking when Sta-
tionary and Automatic Parking Brake Applica-
tion functions. If the functions are not deacti-
vated, the brake system will seize when the
vehicle is stationary and the vehicle will not be
able to roll.
```
```
CAUTION
For automatic car washes in which the vehicle
is pulled forward on rolling wheels:
```
1. Before washing the vehicle, make sure
    that the automatic rain sensor is deacti-
    vated. If it is not deactivated and inadver-
    tently starts, the wiper arms could be
    damaged.
2. To help prevent damage from the auto-
    matic car wash machinery, make sure
    that the door mirrors are folded in, anten-
    nas retracted or removed, and any auxili-
    ary lights secured.
3. Drive into the automatic car wash.
4. Turn off the "Automatic Braking when
    Stationary" function using the switch in
    the tunnel console.
5. Turn off the "Automatic Parking Brake
    Application" function in the center dis-
    play's Top view.
6. Turn off the engine by turning the start
    knob in the tunnel console clockwise.
    Hold the knob in position for at least
    2 seconds.
The vehicle is now ready for the automatic car
wash.

```
Corrosion protection
Your vehicle is constructed with effective protec-
tion against corrosion.
```
```
Corrosion protection for the body consists of
modern metallic protective coatings on the sheet
metal, a high-quality painting process, corrosion-
protected and minimized metal overlap, and
shielding plastic components, abrasion protection
and supplemental rust inhibitor in exposed areas.
In the chassis, exposed components of the wheel
suspension are made of corrosion-resistant cast
aluminum.
```
```
Inspection and maintenance
The corrosion protection does not normally
require maintenance, but keeping the vehicle
clean is always a good way to further reduce the
risk of corrosion. The use of strong alkaline or
acidic cleaning fluids should always be avoided
on shiny body components. Any stone chips in
the paint should be touched up as soon as they
are discovered.

    aged surface. Pull the tape off so that any
    loose flakes of paint adhere to it.
    If the damage goes down to the bare metal,
    you may need to use primer first. If the paint
    damage is on a plastic surface, an adhesive
    primer should be used for better results.
    Spray the primer into the lid of the spray can
    and brush on thinly.
2. Light sanding with a very fine-grained sand-
    paper or similar may be required before
    painting (e.g. if there are uneven edges).
    Clean the area carefully and let it dry.
3. Thoroughly mix the primer and apply it with a
    small brush, toothpick or similar. When the
    primer is dry, apply one or more coats of
    paint and then a clear coat, letting the paint
    dry between each application.

If there is a longer scratch, follow the same pro-
cedure as above, but first mask off the surround-
ing area to protect the undamaged paint.

Touch-up pens and spray paints are available at
Volvo retailers.

```
NOTE
If the stone chip has not gone down to the
bare metal and an undamaged coat of paint
remains, apply base coat and clear coat
immediately after cleaning the surface.
